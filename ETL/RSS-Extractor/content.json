(Shout out to the Instagram algorithm for watching my behavior and correctly identifying me as a carb hound!)\n\nThat being said: it\u2019s important to recognize that Instagram Reels are a different beast than the main feed. Like my eyebrows (and your eyebrows too, accept it!), these two formats are sisters, not twins. Our video on the Instagram Reels algorithm highlights some of the differences:\n\nSo even if you\u2019ve honed in on the perfect length for your Instagram captions; even if you know exactly which hashtags perform best for your pumpkin patch photo shoots; even if you\u2019ve obsessively researched how many hashtags are ideal to use to launch a cool new sparkling water for dogs\u2026 Instagram Reels demand a slightly different strategy, with a unique set of trend-worthy hashtags.\n\nWhat are those hashtags? I am so glad you asked! Presenting: a copy-and-paste-ready list of specific hashtags to use for your fitness Reels, funny Reels, travel Reels, food Reels, and fashion Reels. And you know what?

Even if you just pop a few into the caption of your Reel, you\u2019re giving your video a chance to go further than your own followers.\n\nYour Reels will appear in search results and in the Explore feed\n\nHashtags are one of the most effective ways to expand your reach on Instagram and grow your audience. They\u2019re what allow interested searchers to find (and fall in love with!) your works of art.\n\nSay you\u2019re a fashion brand with a chic new collection of capes (the dream). Film a quick runway strut, craft a cool Reel, and toss a #witches hashtag into the mix. You\u2019ve instantly planted your vid among other hot witchy content: a business move more powerful than any spell.\n\nYour Reels can appear in users\u2019 feeds\n\nUsers can also follow hashtags, allowing your Instagram posts with hashtags to appear in their feeds even if they don\u2019t follow your Instagram account specifically. The right hashtag could be the key to getting your content in front of people who aren\u2019t actively searching for the term. Cha-ching!\n\nHere\u2019s another food-related example. Tag your Reel with #sandwich, and your upper-crust content will be served up on a platter to anyone who follows this delish \u2018tag.\n\nYou\u2019ll engage your community\n\nInstagram hashtags can be a great way of communicating your brand values \u2014 e.g., when you tag your hot capes with #witches, the world now knows that your brand is edgy and fun, and that your fall collection is ready to go from the runway to the coven in a snap.\n\nOriginal hashtags can also be a way to encourage followers to engage with your brand. A branded hashtag can help fans connect with each other and provide you with plenty of user-generated content to draw from.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no need to invent a community or movement from scratch. You can also use existing hashtags to connect with communities that are already thriving online. For instance, if you want to connect with Instagram\u2019s literary elite (a.k.a. people who won\u2019t stop bragging about reading real paper books), tag your related posts as #bookstagram to join the conversation.\n\n#1 Social Media Tool Create. Schedule. Publish. Engage. Measure. Win. Free 30-Day Trial\n\nHow to find the right Reels hashtags for your brand\n\nThere are more possible hashtags to use than there are words in the English language. Some of them are emojis, for instance, and if a picture is worth a thousand words\u2026 well, you do the math. How do you know where to begin \u2014 and, just as importantly, where to stop?\n\nThe right hashtags get you in front of relevant people (and hopefully lots of \u2018em). The wrong ones could mislead your target audience or attract trolls\u2026 and not the fun kind with jewels in their belly buttons, as I learned the hard way.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly room for experimentation in the hashtag-a-verse, but starting with a little research to find the right hashtags for your brand will at least set you off in the right direction.\n\nWatch what your audience is doing\n\nWhat kind of hashtags are your followers using in their own content? What pops up again and again in the subcultures that are relevant to your demographic? Tap into the community\u2019s existing hashtags to showcase your Instagram Reels to your target market.\n\nA social media listening tool like Hootsuite is a great way to keep an eye on your dream audience. You\u2019re not spying! You\u2019re listening!\n\nCheck out the competition\n\nI\u2019m not saying that you should be a copycat (which, as any second-grader knows, is the greatest crime of all). But there\u2019s a lot you can learn from watching what your industry peers are up to.\n\nTake a look at the hashtags your competitors are using with a \u200b\u200bcompetitive social media analysis. Note what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not for clues that could inform your own social media strategy. Learn from the rest, and, um, you\u2019ll be the best. (Not a saying, but it should be.)\n\nUse third-party hashtag generators\n\nSites like For Display Purposes Only track trending Reels (and trending hashtags) extensively, and can be a good resource for brainstorming around a word. (Find more suggestions for hashtag generators here in our \u201chow to hashtag\u201d guide.)\n\nBefore you go copying and pasting all the suggested terms, though, make sure to do your homework and research just how many hashtags will optimize your reach: there\u2019s some speculation that you can have too much of a good thing.\n\nPulling in the likes and the follows with Instagram Reels starts with great content, of course: videos that are educational or entertaining, videos that look great and represent your brand authentically. But if you\u2019re making those quality vids in a vacuum, what\u2019s the point? Use the right hashtags for Instagram Reels to get the reach your content deserves.\n\nInvesting the time and effort into getting your Instagram Reels strategy in place is going to pay off in more than just views. A successful Reel can help boost your overall engagement on the social media platform, too.\n\nWant to learn more about reveling in the world of Reels? We\u2019ve got you covered with our beginner-friendly guide to using Instagram Reels for business.\n\nSchedule Reels ahead of time to save time and take the pressure off posting. Hootsuite lets you post and monitor the performance of your Reels so you can easily explain to your boss why you made her learn that trending dance.\n\nGet Started", "date": "2023-07-07"}, {"link": "https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-hashtags/", "title": "Instagram Hashtags: Free Hashtag Generator + 100 Ideas", "content": "Instagram hashtags can make or break your Instagram strategy. Use them correctly and you\u2019ll get your posts seen by more people.\n\nIf you want your content to get in front of as many people as possible (and isn\u2019t that the whole point of this social media thing?), embracing an Instagram hashtag strategy is key.\n\nHashtags are a powerful tool for discovery on the photo- and video-sharing app (and, tbh, on all your other favorite social media accounts, too). You may have heard whispers that Instagram is improving its keyword-search capability, but those good ol\u2019 humble hashtags remain an incredibly effective way to reach the audiences you crave\u2026 and we dare say, deserve.\n\nReady to level up your Instagram hashtag game? You\u2019re in the right place. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nInstagram hashtag generator\n\nWave your magic hashtag wand (by that we mean: fill out the form below) and watch your reach and engagement grow fast on Instagram. Make sure to follow the best practices outlined later in this post for maximum success, too.\n\nPlease note: This tool may display inaccurate or offensive material that doesn\u2019t represent Hootsuite\u2019s views. You\u2019re solely responsible for use of any content generated using this tool, including its compliance with applicable laws and third party rights.\n\nA hashtag is a combination of letters, numbers, and/or emoji preceded by the # symbol (e.g., #NoFilter). Instagram hashtags are used to categorize or label content and make it more discoverable.\n\nYou can add hashtags to the caption of your Instagram post or Reel, or include them in text elements on your Instagram Story. They are a great way to expand your Instagram audience and get more reach.\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019ve posted a photo of a skunk on a surfboard, you might pair it with the caption \u201cThe waves really stink today #surfing #surflife #animalssurfing #skunks #wildlifewednesday.\u201d\n\nYou can make up your own hashtag (#skunkswhosurf), or add one that other people are already using \u2014 like#surflife, which has more than three million posts.\n\nAnyone who conducts an Instagram hashtag search will see a page showing all the posts, Stories and Reels tagged with that hashtag.\n\nHashtags are clickable. Anyone who clicks on an Instagram hashtag will view all other posts that use the same hashtag.\n\nPeople can also choose to follow hashtags, which means they can see your hashtagged post in their feed even if they don\u2019t follow you (yet!).\n\nThat being said: we recently ran an experiment looking specifically at the effectiveness of Instagram SEO vs Hashtags\u2026 and let\u2019s just say the results were eye-opening.\n\nCheck out the article or watch the video below to see what we found:\n\nThese are the most popular Instagram hashtags as of the writing of this article. But remember: the most popular Instagram hashtags are not necessarily the most effective.\n\nA large number of posts may mean lots of people follow that hashtag, but it also means there\u2019s a ton of content on it and your posts might get lost. Consider using a combination of popular and niche hashtags to reach different audiences, from broad to specific.\n\nTop 50 hashtags on Instagram\n\n#love (2.1B) #instagood (1.6B) #fashion (1.1B) #photooftheday (1B) #photography (1B) #art (1B) #beautiful (816M) #nature (771M) #picoftheday (714M) #happy (693M) #follow (687M) #travel (685M) #cute (660M) #style (634M) #instadaily (627M) #tbt (581M) #followme (553M) #summer (539M) #beauty (522M) #fitness (514M) #like4like (514M) #food (502M) #instalike (493M) #photo (482M) #selfie (450M) #friends (436M) #music (434M) #smile (432M) #family (432M) life (431M) #fun (430M) #girl (424M) #likeforlikes (385M) #motivation (344M) #lifestyle (338M) #likeforlike (327M) #sunset (320M) #amazing (286M) #nofilter (284M) #instamood (276M) #sun (269M) #follow4follow (250M) #inspiration (235M) #followforfollow (211M) #instapic (205M) #bestoftheday (200M) #cool (165M) #swag (144M) #night (144M) #happybirthday (121M)\n\nPopular B2B hashtags\n\n#smallbusiness (118M) #business (107M) #entrepreneur (97M #socialmedia (35M) #digitalmarketing (28M) #sales (20M) #tech (19M) #leadership (18M) #innovation (13M) #networking (12M) #SEO (9.1M) #contentmarketing (7.3M) #marketingstrategy (6.9M) #businesstips (5.8M) #startups (5.4M) #productivity (3.9M) #strategy (3.8M) #b2b (2.9M) #consulting (2.9M) #workplace (2.3M) #professionaldevelopment (1.3M) #leadgeneration (940K) #b2bmarketing (575K) #saas (516K) #thoughtleadership (194K)\n\nPopular B2C hashtags\n\n#fashion (1B) #beauty (522M) #fitness (514M) #explore (468M) #lifestyle (338M) #foodporn (296M) #foodie (238M) #instafood (234M) #instafashion (182M) #travelgram (171M) #shopping (153M) #homedecor (138M) #fashionista (134M) #instatravel (124M) #sale (95M) #shoplocal (81M) #summervibes (58M) #instabeauty (26M) #styleinspo (24M) #discount (13M) #instashop (10M) #healthAndwellness (8M) #instasale (1.7M) #productreview (1.2M) #b2c (387K)\n\nHashtags for Instagram likes\n\n#love (2.1B) #instagood (1.6B) #instagram (1B) #follow (687M) #instadaily (627M) #instalike (493M) #like (356M) #explorepage (324M) #followforfollowback (284M) #instamood (276M) #insta (206M) #fyp (182M) #instafashion (182M) #daily (168M) #like4likes (142M) #instalove (135M) #instaphoto (121M) #likeforlikes (112M) #instacool (108M) #followers (104M) #comedy (79.5) #like4follow (73.1M) #follow4followback (67.5M) #likeme (42.7) #likesforlikes (11M)\n\nDog Instagram hashtags\n\n#dog (363M) #dogsofinstagram (303M) #dogs (164M) #instadog (114M) #doglover (93.7M) #dogoftheday (82.M) #ilovemydog (49.6M) #rescuedog (26.2M) #doglove (23.4M) #dogphotography (19.2M) #dogmom (17.5M) #dogmodel (10.5M) #Dogsitting (10.1M) #Dogofinstagram (9.7M) #dogtraining (8.4M) #doglife (6.1M) #Doggrooming (6.1M) #Doginstagram (4.1M) #doginfluencer (1.9M) #dogboarding (1.7M) #dogsmile (1.7M) #Dogselfie (1.7M) #dogpics (1M) #doggram (1.5M) #Dogadventures (1.3M)\n\nFitness Instagram hashtags\n\n#fitness (514M) #gym (250M) #workout (214M) #health (162M) #fitnessmotivation (137M) #bodybuilding (132M) #healthy (119M) #yoga (116M) #running (88.3M) #body (63.3M) #run (59.9M) #fitnessmodel (59.4M) #gymmotivation (54.7M) #cardio (51M) #fitnessaddict (45.5M) #fitnessjourney (38.4M) #getfit (35.3M) #fitmom (29.1M) #workoutmotivation (24.8M) #gymrat (22M) #fitnesslifestyle (17.4M) #yogainspiration (16.7M) #sweat (16.1M) #strengthtraining (12.3M) #gymgirl (10.5M)\n\nArt hashtags for Instagram\n\n#art (1B) #photography (1B) #artist (310M) #drawing (283M) #artwork (193M) #digitalart (135M) #artistsoninstagram (110M) #draw (104M) #instaart (92.8M) #artoftheday (76.5M) #contemporaryart (66.6M) #paint (54.5) #abstractart (46.8M) #artgallery (43.6M) #artistic (28.3M) #artofinstagram (22.9M) #artcollector (16.9M) #modernart (15M) #tattooart (14M) #urbanart (14M) #picsart (14M) #artists (13M) #artlover (11.1M) #artdaily (6.7M) #artjournal (5M)\n\nFor best results, limit yourself to 3 to 5 hashtags per Instagram post (or Story, or Reel).\n\nTechnically, you can post up to 30 hashtags\u2026 but too many hashtags can look spammy and may even hurt your reach.\n\nThis advice is coming straight from Instagram itself, but if you want more evidence that sticking to 3 to 5 Instagram hashtags is a good idea, we actually put this to the test. Our little experiment found that, yep, 3 to 5 Instagram hashtags is the sweet spot. (Read the full, thrilling recap of our Instagram hashtag experiment here!)\n\nAnd remember: Instagram\u2019s search tool also analyzes the actual content of your captions, too\u2026 so hashtags aren\u2019t your only way to make an impression. Write informative, clear captions packed with search terms and keywords to take advantage of social SEO.\n\nThere are really no rules about what an Instagram hashtag can be, but you can loosely sort hashtags into one of these 10 categories:\n\nProduct or service hashtags\n\nThese are basic keywords to describe your product or service, like #handbag or #divebar\n\nNiche hashtags\n\nThese get a little more specific, showing where you fit in the context of your industry, like #travelblogger or #foodblogger\n\nIndustry Instagram community hashtags\n\nCommunities exist on Instagram, and these hashtags help you find and join them. Think #gardenersofinstagram or #craftersofinstgram\n\nSpecial event or seasonal hashtags\n\nThese can refer to real holidays or seasons, like #summerdays, or they can be used for all those National [Thing] Day holidays, like #nationalicecreamday or #nationalnailpolishday\n\nLocation hashtags\n\nEven if you geo-tag your Instagram post, it can still be a good idea to include a hashtag that refers to your location, like #vancouvercraftbeer or #londoneats\n\nBonus: Download a free checklist that reveals the exact steps a fitness influencer used to grow from 0 to 600,000+ followers on Instagram with no budget and no expensive gear.\n\nDaily hashtags\n\nEvery day has plenty of its own hashtags, from #MondayBlues right through to #SundayFunday. We created a whole list of daily hashtags for you to choose from if you\u2019re looking for an easy source of hashtags to add to your posts.\n\nRelevant phrase hashtags\n\nThese hashtags combine elements of product hashtags, niche hashtags, and community hashtags. Basically, they\u2019re phrases people use on Instagram to connect to existing communities in a slightly insider way, like #amwriting or #shewhowanders\n\nAcronym hashtags\n\nPerhaps the best-known acronym hashtag is #TBT for Throwback Thursday. Other popular acronym hashtags include #OOTD for outfit of the day, #FBF for flashback Friday, and #YOLO for you only live once.\n\nEmoji hashtags\n\nThese hashtags can include emojis on their own, like #\ud83d\ude0e, or words or phrases with emojis attached, like #sunglasses\ud83d\ude0e.\n\nBranded hashtags\n\nThese are custom hashtags that relate to your brand or a specific campaign, like #starbucksboy or #slurpeesummer. These can be a great way to encourage community building around your brand, keep track of user-generated content or even encourage employee ambassadorship.\n\nInstagram Hashtag FAQs\n\nDo hashtags work on Instagram?\n\nYes, hashtags work on Instagram.\n\nYou can tag your posts, Stories or Reels with hashtags. Though Instagram allows a maximum of 30 hashtags, we\u2019ve found that 3 to 5 Instagram hashtags is the real sweet spot.\n\nHow to add hashtags on Instagram\n\nAdd hashtags to your Instagram content just as you would other text content.\n\nIf you\u2019re creating a post or a Reel, simply include the hashtag in your caption.\n\nIf you\u2019re creating an Instagram Story, add a text element in Create mode and just type in your preferred hashtag.\n\nHow to hide hashtags on Instagram\n\nTo hide a hashtag on an Instagram post or Reel, just add it as a comment instead of a caption.\n\nYou might also want to write the caption, hit the return button several times, and adding a caption a few lines down. That way, the hashtags will be hidden unless a viewer expands the caption.\n\nIf you\u2019re adding a hashtag to an Instagram Story, make the text element very, very, very small and move it somewhere on the image or video where it can blend in. You might also consider layering another visual element over top to bury it, like a sticker. (Learn more Instagram Story hacks here.)\n\nHow to find trending hashtags on Instagram\n\nUnlike Twitter, Instagram doesn\u2019t publicize a list of trending hashtags. (Why you so shy, Insta?!)\n\nHowever, if you search for a hashtag on Instagram, you\u2019ll see how many posts use that hashtag. You\u2019ll also see a list of other popular Instagram hashtags using similar words, with post counts included too.\n\nTo search for a hashtag on desktop, enter the hashtag including the # symbol into the search box. On mobile, enter your search term in the search box, then tap Tags.\n\nIf you\u2019re paying attention to your Instagram feed, you\u2019ll learn to quickly spot trending hashtags as they emerge. Don\u2019t be too quick to jump on a trend, though. Only post using a trending hashtag if it really makes sense for your business, and for the specific content in your post.\n\nHow to create a hashtag on Instagram\n\nCreating a hashtag on Instagram couldn\u2019t be easier: just type the hashtag symbol (#) followed by a word. Done! You\u2019ve just invented a hashtag (and made us incredibly proud in the process).\n\nHow many hashtags are allowed on Instagram?\n\nYou can use up to 30 hashtags on any Instagram image or video\u2026 but we actually don\u2019t recommend maxing that out. You\u2019ll look spammy, and may even be punished by the Instagram algorithm.\n\nInstead, pick 3 to 5 of your favorite hashtags for best results on Instagram.\n\nHow to block hashtags on Instagram\n\nWhile you can\u2019t block hashtags that are posted by accounts you follow, you can create a block to prevent certain hashtags from appearing in your suggested content.\n\nGo to your profile, tap the three-horizontal-line menu button on the top right. Tap \u201csettings,\u201d then \u201csuggested content\u201d. Tap \u201cspecific words and phrases,\u201d and then add the hashtag or keywords you\u2019d like to hide.\n\nCan you add numbers to hashtags on Instagram?\n\nYep, you can add numbers to hashtags on Instagram\u2026 emojis, too! #prettycool2023\ud83e\udd2f\n\nHow to search multiple hashtags on Instagram\n\nThe Instagram app itself doesn\u2019t actually work well for multiple hashtag searches (though because of its improved keyword searchability, you might find some relevant results anyways).\n\nFor more accurate search results for multiple hashtags on Instagram, head to Google and search \u201csite.instagram.com\u201d followed by all the hashtags your heart desires. This will pull up posts tagged with all of the indicated hashtags.\n\nHow to find the best Instagram hashtags for YOUR brand\n\nThe internet is full of Instagram hashtag generators, but the truth is, you\u2019ll get the most effective results if you do the legwork yourself. And that means\u2026\n\nScoping out your competition\n\nObviously you don\u2019t want to be a copycat. But there\u2019s always lots to learn from watching others in your industry. What\u2019s working for them? What community groups might they be tapping into with their tag strategy? What hashtags are they using that you definitely want to avoid?\n\nTools like Brandwatch for Hootsuite are super helpful for analyzing competitors and scoping out industry trends.\n\nSpy on your audience\n\nOkay, maybe \u201cspy\u201d is a harsh word\u2026 but how about eavesdropping? If your desired audience is using certain hashtags as a community identifier or to participate in a conversation, this could be a great tag for you to try out, too.\n\nPro tip: Use social listening tools like Hootsuite streams to keep an eye on all your audience, your nemesis and industry heroes, all with one convenient dashboard.\n\nLet Instagram guide you\n\nWhen you pop a word into the Instagram search tool, you\u2019ll see a bunch of related search terms pop up as suggestions. These are often relevant phrases that might score you an even wider (or more niche!) reach.\n\nFor instance, you might know instinctively to label your crochet pattern post with #crochet, but Instagram also suggests the labels #crochetaddict, #crochetlove, and #crochetersofinstagram \u2014 specific, community-oriented hashtags that have millions of posts each.\n\nMake your own branded hashtag\n\nOn Instagram, anyone can create a totally unique hashtag to promote a campaign or your brand as a whole. In other words: the best hashtag for your brand was inside of you all along!\n\nLet your audience know about your hashtag by highlighting it in captions and Stories, or even including it in your Instagram bio. Promote your branded hashtag with a contest, and collect some awesome user-generated content along the way.\n\nExplore the Explore page\n\nInstagram\u2019s algorithm may be sliiiiightly mysterious, but these posts all ended up on the Explore page because they were engaging in some way. Learn a little something by peeping featured posts and making note of their hashtag choices. If you notice any patterns emerging, there\u2019s no harm in trying to mimic their success.\n\nUse Hootsuite\u2019s AI hashtag suggestions\n\nOkay, earlier, we were dunking on hashtag generators, it\u2019s true\u2026 but this one is different.\n\nHootsuite\u2019s AI technology analyzes both your caption and the images you\u2019ve uploaded to suggest the most relevant tags. These are going to be a unique-to-you combination of tags, and one that you can use right in Hootsuite Composer.\n\nLearn more about our cool new robot writer friend here!\n\nUse the right amount of hashtags\n\nLimit your hashtags to 3 to 5 on Instagram. Yes, you technically can include up to 30, but we\u2019ve discovered that fewer is really going to get you better engagement and reach.\n\nStudy your analytics\n\nTake the time to review which hashtags are working best for you. Hootsuite Insights offers helpful analytics in a beautiful package to help social media managers understand what tags are successful and which ones are flops.\n\nIncorporate your hashtags at the end\n\nPop your hashtags at the end of your caption (or even post them in a comment!) instead of incorporating them into the text. Using hashtags in the middle of your captions or comments might make your content less accessible to people using text-to-speech readers.\n\nLearn more about accessibility for social media here.\n\nPick the best hashtags, not the most popular ones\n\nChoose hashtags that will attract quality followers, not just a large quantity of followers. Just because a hashtag like #followme has millions of posts doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s going to pull in the kind of target audience you actually want \u2014 you might find your follower count jump with bots and spammers, which could be a turn-off for real potential customers.\n\nLook for hashtags that accurately represent what you\u2019re all about, whether that\u2019s a literal description of your product or services (#bookstore), or a shout-out to a community that you\u2019re part of (#bookloversofinstagram). Ideally, aim for a mix of broad hashtags and niche ones that all are relevant and meaningful to your brand and audience.\n\nDon\u2019t repeat yourself\n\nIt might be tempting to simply copy and paste the same long list of hashtags on every post, but don\u2019t do it.\n\nInstagram\u2019s community guidelines clearly state that \u201cposting repetitive comments or content\u201d is not okay. If you use the same hashtags for every post, your content will be penalized by the Instagram algorithm.\n\nCheck the hashtag\u2019s meaning\n\nBecause hashtags are sometimes made up of multiple words running together (#hereisanexample), misunderstandings can sometimes happen. Proofread any new hashtags with a dirty mind to make sure you catch any accidental swears.\n\nIf you\u2019re using slang or an acronym, it\u2019s wise to do a quick search to make sure you\u2019re not accidentally posting something offensive, too. Maybe at your store, \u201cB.D.E.\u201d means \u201cBig Deals Everyday!\u201d but the internet might have another idea all together.\n\nHide your hashtags (if you want!)\n\nIf you find your hashtags are distracting from your incredible caption, you can always tuck them away out of sight. You can do this by either placing them several lines below the caption (which will keep them hidden unless someone clicks \u201csee more\u201d) or pop them into a separate comment.\n\nChoose diverse hashtags\n\nInstead of picking five hashtags that are variations on a theme (#dogs, #puppies, #doggos, #goodboys, #furryfriends), try to hit different types of search terms with each of your tags.\n\nFor instance, maybe one hashtag is related to your location (#boston) while another attempts to connect with community (#dogmoms) and another promotes your branded contest (#staceyssummerdogfashioncontest).\n\nDon\u2019t use banned hashtags\n\nSome hashtags\u2014like #nudity or #youngmodel\u2014get used inappropriately so frequently by users that Instagram basically hides them away.\n\n(Rumor has it that using banned hashtags might even get you shadowbanned but\u2026 well, the jury is still out on that.)\n\nSome of these tags are blacklisted temporarily, others permanently, but it\u2019s hard to predict exactly what will be ruined next (we\u2019ve seen websites claim that #skateboarding is banned! Why! What did you guys do?!) so it\u2019s a good idea to double-check that your fave hashtags are working before you go ahead and schedule that post.\n\nStart building your Instagram presence using Hootsuite.

Obviously.\n\nFacebook captions for selfies\n\nSharing a selfie on your Facebook page? It\u2019s the perfect opportunity to drop a playful one-liner. Remember to choose captions that reflect your personality and the mood of your selfie \u2014 unless you\u2019re going for a little hit of irony, of course.\n\nJust me, myself, and my selfie. Feeling fabulous and taking selfies to prove it. Selfie game strong. \ud83d\udcaa When life gives you lemons \u2014 take a selfie. \ud83c\udf4b Capturing the moment with a perfect selfie.

Here are a few suggestions for captioning your Facebook profile picture. (Remember to choose a profile picture that represents you or your company, and use captions that reflect the vibe you want to convey with your account.)\n\nNew profile picture, same awesome me. Proof that I clean up nice. Putting my best face forward. \ud83d\udcf8 Elevating the profile picture game, one snap at a time. They say a picture is worth a thousand likes. Challenge accepted. \ud83e\udd1d Ready to take on the world, one profile picture at a time. This profile picture was carefully crafted to make your newsfeed a better place.

A picture may be worth a thousand words, but this profile picture is worth a million.\n\nShort Facebook captions\n\nSometimes, you want to keep things short and sweet \u2014 we get it! Short Facebook captions can be impactful. Keep things concise by letting the image or video do most of the talking, and use a few carefully chosen words add context or deeper meaning.\n\nLiving my best life. Embracing the chaos. \ud83d\ude43 Just being me. Keep smiling. \ud83d\ude01 Enjoying the little things. Chasing dreams. \ud83d\udcad Happiness is contagious. Beauty is everywhere. \ud83d\udc90 Stay positive. Making memories. Follow your heart. Savor each moment. Creating my own sunshine. \u2600\ufe0f Living in the present. Spreading love and laughter.\n\nBirthday Facebook captions\n\nThese Facebook birthday captions are great for personal celebrations, of course, but if you\u2019re working on creating content for your brand, just tweak the language slightly to make these phrases a fit for work anniversaries or milestones. Never! Stop! Celebrating!\n\nAnother year older, another good excuse to celebrate. Birthdays are nature\u2019s way of telling us to eat more cake. It\u2019s my party, and I\u2019ll eat a bunch of cake if I want to. Well, I guess this is [age]. Not too shabby. Cheers to another trip around the sun. Happy birthday to me. \ud83c\udf82 Birthdays are the perfect excuse to indulge in cake and celebrate life. What more could you want? On this special day, I\u2019m grateful for all the love, laughter, and blessings in my life. Happy birthday to me! Today is the day the world was blessed with my presence.

Today, I\u2019m blowing out candles and making some big wishes. It\u2019s not just a birthday; it\u2019s a day to celebrate the awesomeness that is me. Get on board! Like a fine wine, I get better with age. \ud83c\udf77 I may be turning a year older, but my spirit remains forever young.\n\nOne-word Facebook captions\n\nThe ultimate in minimalism: it\u2019s the one-word Facebook caption. Sure, you could reach for the dictionary or thesaurus, but you\u2019re already here, so help yourself to any of these powerful solo words and line \u2018em up for your next few scheduled Facebook posts.\n\nUnstoppable. Grateful. Adventurous. Radiant. Empowered. Joyful. Vibes. Inspired. Blessed. Dreamer. Thriving. Serenity. Fearless. Wonder. Elevate.\n\nCute Facebook captions\n\nThere\u2019s enough rough stuff happening out there in the world. If you want to cultivate a Facebook page that\u2019s just full of joy and sunshine, we don\u2019t blame you. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve pulled together these too-cute Facebook captions.

Creating a life I love, one smile at a time. \ud83d\udc95 Finding beauty in the simplest moments. \u2600\ufe0f Sunshine and smiles, that\u2019s my recipe for a happy day. Love yourself and let that love shine bright. Enjoying the journey as much as the destination. Living life with a grateful heart and an open mind. \ud83c\udf05 Appreciating the beauty that surrounds us, both inside and out.\n\nFall Facebook captions\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that \u2018loving fall\u2019 has turned into a clich\u00e9: Fall is the best. Don\u2019t let the haters, or Bo Burnham, get you down.\n\nThese fall-themed captions can help capture the essence of the glorious, most-leaf-filled season and add a touch of autumnal charm to your Facebook posts. Pass us a pumpkin spice latte: we\u2019re getting cozy.\n\nFalling for the colors of autumn. Sweater weather and pumpkin spice everything. \ud83c\udf83 Leaves are falling, and I\u2019m embracing the change. \ud83c\udf42 Autumn leaves and cozy vibes. Crisp air, warm drinks, and fall adventures. \ud83c\udf42 Autumn is nature\u2019s way of showing us how beautiful it is to let things go. \ud83c\udf42 Falling in love with the magic of autumn. \ud83c\udf42 Pumpkin kisses and harvest wishes. Fall: the season that teaches us to let go and trust in new beginnings. Embracing the beauty of nature\u2019s paintbrush. Finding joy in the little things, like jumping in a pile of leaves. Autumn skies and pumpkin pies. Wandering through the golden hues of fall. \ud83c\udf41 Autumn whispers, \u2018change is beautiful.\u2019 Let\u2019s fall into autumn\u2019s embrace together.\n\nSummer Facebook captions\n\nOkay, we know we just said that Fall is the best, but we forgot about summer. Summer! That\u2019s where it\u2019s at. And of course you want to honor these sunny, sunny days with an appropriately warm Facebook caption. Whether you\u2019re at the beach, travelling, or simply working on your sunburn, here\u2019s a sampling of words to help express the seasonal excitement.\n\nSunshine and good times. \u2600\ufe0f Summer vibes and sandy toes. Chasing sunsets and making memories. Salty hair, don\u2019t care. \ud83d\ude0e Life\u2019s a beach, enjoy the waves. \ud83c\udf0a Living on flip-flops and ice cream. \ud83c\udf66 Sippin\u2019 on sunshine. Summer state of mind. Finding paradise wherever I go. \ud83c\udf34 \u2600\ufe0f Sun-kissed and summer blessed. Lazy days and warm rays. Making a splash in the summer fun. \u2600\ufe0f Embracing the heat and loving every minute of it. Long days, short nights, endless adventures. Soaking up the sun and making every day count. \ud83c\udfdd\n\nFacebook captions for couples\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to hard-launch a new relationship on main, reach for one of these Facebook captions for couples. (These captions probably aren\u2019t appropriate for your Facebook brand page, but we don\u2019t know what line of business you\u2019re in \u2014 you do you!)\n\nWith you, every moment is a fairytale. \ud83d\udc9d Love is in the air, and it\u2019s all because of you.

You\u2019re the missing piece to my puzzle of happiness. Love is a journey, and I\u2019m glad to have you by my side. Forever isn\u2019t long enough with you. \ud83d\udc96 Building a future together, one step at a time. You\u2019re not just my partner, you\u2019re my best friend and soulmate.\n\nWriting the perfect Facebook caption is obviously a subjective task, but you\u2019ve gotta start somewhere.

Unlock +100 free social media content ideas and never worry about writer\u2019s block again!\n\nBe concise\n\nKeep your caption short and to the point. According to our research about the ideal Facebook post length, that means somewhere in the 50 to 80 character range.\n\nCaptions that are too long might get overlooked or lose the reader\u2019s interest. Plus, Facebook cuts off longer posts with an ellipsis, forcing users to click \u201cSee More\u201d to expand the text and read the entire message.\n\nBesides that, long or spammy-looking captions with lots of links and hashtags might be punished by the Facebook algorithm.\n\nIn the effort of practicing what we preach, we\u2019ll stop there: TLDR, when it comes to Facebook captions, less is more!\n\nAsk a question or encourage engagement\n\nAny of the copy-and-paste Facebook caption templates above might inspire a like or a share, but not a lot of them will necessarily prompt engagement. If you want to spark some lively discussion, try asking a question with your Facebook caption, or invite your followers to share their related thoughts or experiences.\n\nHere are 19 ideas for creating super-engaging posts.\n\nConsider your audience\n\nThe #1 rule for creating any kind of winning content, whether visual or textual? Always keep your audience in mind.\n\nWhen you\u2019re crafting your Facebook captions, consider the interests and perspectives of your unique group of followers. For instance, if your audience is made up of digital nomads, your captions might reference memes or modern slang. But if your audience is made up of, say, patriotic grandmas, your most successful captions will likely have a different sort of tone and focus.\n\nRomper\u2019s audience is Millennial moms, so the overly familiar language and slang it uses on Facebook feels totes apprope.\n\nNot sure who your followers are (or who they should be)? Here\u2019s how to find your social media target market.\n\nUse Hootsuite\n\nPretty cool news: Hootsuite now comes with OwlyWriter AI, a built-in creative AI tool that saves social media pros hours of work. It does way more than our free caption generator.\n\nYou can use OwlyWriter to:\n\nWrite a new social media caption in a specific tone or brand voice, based on a prompt\n\nWrite a post based on a link (e.g. a blog post or a product page)\n\nGenerate unlimited post ideas based on a keyword or topic (and then write posts expanding on the idea you like best)\n\nIdentify and repurpose your top-performing posts\n\nCreate relevant captions for upcoming holidays\n\nHere\u2019s a quickie walk-through of how to use this magical AI content creation tool:\n\nTo get started with OwlyWriter, sign in to your Hootsuite account and head to the Inspiration section of the dashboard. Then, pick the type of AI magic you want to see in action.\n\nReflect your brand voice\n\nWhatever your Facebook post is about, and whether you\u2019re posting as an individual or a brand, your caption should reflect your own unique voice and style. Whether it\u2019s funny, heartfelt, or thought-provoking, make sure it represents who you are.\n\nFor brands: if you haven\u2019t identified your brand voice as part of a broader social media marketing strategy, it\u2019s time to ask yourself, \u2018what qualities and values should this brand embody?\u2019 If you\u2019re an upscale jewelery company, words like \u2018luxurious\u2019 and \u2018elegant\u2019 should guide the tone of your posts, for example.\n\nIt\u2019s totally appropriate for Fenty Beauty, as a young, hip, beauty brand, to use a million emojis, slang, and playful spelling (\u201csumma\u201d) in the caption for this Facebook Reel.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reel/1608392309642119\n\nOf course, on Facebook, users don\u2019t necessarily expect a formal tone from brands (depending on the industry and audience). In fact, keeping things light \u2014 and maybe even funny! \u2014 is the norm.\n\nBut whether you\u2019re providing a little entertainment or seriously dealing with a social media crisis, work to keep one consistent tone or perspective. (Creating social media style guide can help with that, especially if you\u2019re working as a team on your social media content calendar.)\n\nMatch the content\n\nForgive us if this one\u2019s a little obvious: consider the content of your post or photo and choose a caption that complements or enhances it.\n\nThis John Deere post, promoting its apparel line, has a fun play on words that underlines both the product offering and the company\u2019s reliable reputation.\n\nA strong Facebook caption ultimately will provide context, add value, or evoke some emotion related to the content.\n\n\u2026 that being said, if your brand voice is a little kooky, maybe a non-sequiter is actually a good fit for your audience.\n\nUse relevant hashtags\n\nIn the copy-and-paste examples above, we didn\u2019t add hashtags, but it\u2019s not a bad idea to include relevant hashtags in your Facebook captions.\n\nThis AppleTV ad for a new Peanuts movie cheekily taps into the popular sports hashtag #FridayNightBaseball.\n\nAfter all, putting the right hashtags in your caption can increase the discoverability of your post. Choose hashtags that are popular and appropriate for the topic or theme of your post, and ideally incorporate some niche ones too.\n\nPro tip: Hootsuite also includes an AI-powered hashtag generator. Simply upload a photo and get tons of suggestions for hashtags that will boost your reach.\n\nTry Hootsuite for free\n\nBrush up on your 2023 hashtag strategy here!\n\nBe funny, be emotional \u2014 just be relatable\n\nPeople are on Facebook for entertainment: use your caption to share a message that makes \u2018em laugh or makes \u2018em feel. Injecting humor or emotion into your caption can make it more relatable and engaging, sparking a connection with your audience and encourage interaction.\n\nUse a call to action\n\nA call for action is ultimately the act of asking for what you want. And your Facebook caption is a great place to do just that. For instance, if your post is shoppable, encourage users to check out the featured products. Want your readers to visit your website? Shout it from the mountaintops! Er, your caption!\n\nIn this Facebook Reels caption, for example, Cadbury asks its followers to tag a competitive dad.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reel/1318654372059140\n\nYour call to action may be the most important part of your Facebook captions, so write it carefully, give it an edit, and maybe even do some testing to see what works best.\n\nEdit and proofread your Facebook caption\n\nBefore posting, take a moment to review and edit your caption. Check for spelling and grammar errors to ensure a polished and professional appearance. (Or let Hootsuite\u2019s built-in Grammarly function give it a proofread.)\n\nBefore you head out there to start captioning up a storm, one important reminder: there is no one-size-fits-all approach to writing the perfect Facebook caption. Experiment with different styles, tones, and formats to see what works best for you and your audience.\n\nManage your Facebook presence alongside your other social media channels using Hootsuite.

Ask them one simple question: How likely are you to recommend the brand? NPS is usually measured on a scale of 1-10, but some use a five-point scale instead.\n\nSource: Shaw Mobile text survey\n\nTo measure NPS, subtract your percentage of detractors (those who would not recommend your brand) from your promoters (those who would). Leave out those who fall in \u201cmaybe\u201d territory\u2014these people are considered \u201cpassives\u201d and don\u2019t impact your score.\n\nNPS = Percentage of promoters \u2013 Percentage of detractors\n\n2. Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)\n\nLike NPS, CSAT involves asking your customers a simple survey question. However, in this case, you just ask them to rate their experience.\n\nSo, instead of asking whether they\u2019d recommend you, you\u2019re just asking how satisfied they are with you. This is one of the most valuable customer service success metrics. It encapsulates the entire customer service experience in one response.\n\nYou can send an NPS survey either after a purchase OR after a customer service interaction. For CSAT, it\u2019s most common to send the survey after a customer service interaction only. You can use a numeric scale, or get creative, like Booking.com did in this CSAT survey:\n\nSource: Booking.com email survey\n\nTo calculate CSAT, divide the number of positive scores on your survey by the total number of replies. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nCSAT = (Number of positive scores/Number of replies) x 100\n\nBy the way, Hootsuite Inbox can automatically send CSAT surveys after each customer service interaction and automatically pull the results into Hootsuite Analytics for easy analysis and reporting.\n\nReduce response time (and your workload) Manage all your messages stress-free with easy routing, saved replies, and friendly chatbots. Try Hootsuite\u2019s Inbox today. Book a Demo\n\n3. Customer effort score (CES)\n\nThis is another metric determined by a simple survey. At first, the survey question looks very similar to that for CSAT. But in this case, rather than asking how satisfied the customer is with the service, you instead ask how easy it was to get the service they needed.\n\nSource: TurboTax email survey\n\nThis gives you a good sense of how well your customer service program is set up. Where CSAT measures the success of a specific interaction, CES measures the ease of accessing support in the first place.\n\nHint: Offering customers support on all the channels where they expect it is a key way to improve CES. Hootsuite Inbox is a great tool to manage customer support across all social channels, keeping customers happy and boosting your CES.\n\nThe formula for calculating CES is the same as for CSAT\u2014it\u2019s just that the survey question addresses a different aspect of customer success. So to calculate CES, divide the number of positive scores on your CES survey by the total number of replies. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nCES = (Number of positive scores/Number of replies) x 100\n\n4. Support ticket categories\n\nFor companies that organize their support tickets by type of issue, it\u2019s important to keep tabs on which problems arise most often. If your CES is high, analyzing which categories receive the most volume can help you identify where customers exert the most effort.\n\nSupport ticket categories may include:\n\nSales question\n\nTechnical issues\n\nCancellations\n\nReturns\n\nShipping\n\nProduct availability\n\nTraffic, page views, Frequently Asked Questions pages, and help articles offer another way to measure where customers require the most assistance.\n\n5. Ticket volume\n\nIn addition to tracking which issues come up most often, it\u2019s just as important to keep an eye on the volume of tickets you receive over time.\n\nSuppose the number of tickets you receive is on the rise\u2014especially in a specific area. In that case, it may be necessary to revisit communications strategies, help articles, or even policies and operations. It\u2019s also crucial for managers to be aware of how much pressure their support teams are under, so they can provide necessary assistance before burnout becomes a problem.\n\nHow do you calculate ticket volume? Record how many tickets you receive at regular intervals: day by day, week by week, or month by month. For visual analysis, plot these results on a line graph (like we do in our customer service report template, which you can download here).\n\nIf you notice spikes, try to pinpoint what may have caused them, such as product releases, global events, or even a social media crisis. That way you can devise plans and better allocate resources in the future.\n\n6. Customer retention rate (CRR)\n\nA customer retention rate measures the number of clients a company retains over a select period.\n\nThis metric is vital for companies that provide a regular or subscription-based service. Depending on the industry, companies may record retention rates weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually.\n\nTo calculate customer retention rate, you\u2019ll need to record:\n\nS = Number of customers at the start of the period\n\nE = Number of customers at the end of the period\n\nN = Number of customers added during the period\n\nWith that information, calculate customer retention rate with the following formula:\n\n[(E-N)/S] *100 = CRR\n\nFor example, say you have 100 customers at the start of your timeframe (S), 90 customers at the end of the period (E), and you added 15 customers (N). Your customer retention rate would be 75%.\n\n7. Churn rate\n\nRemember: Good customer service is about building long-term relationships with customers. Churn rate measures the percentage of your customers that leave your brand versus those that stick around.\n\nCustomer churn rate is measured for a specific amount of time. The most common timeframes are monthly, quarterly, and annual.\n\nTo measure churn rate, take the number of customers you lose over the period and divide it by the total number of customers you had at the start of the period. Don\u2019t include new customers acquired over the period in your equation, since that will skew your results.\n\nChurn rate = (Customers lost over a period/Customers at the start of the period) x 100\n\nYou can also compare churn rates for different segments of your customer base to see if some products or product bundling strategies are creating greater customer success than others.\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan Global High Yield & Leveraged Finance Conference presentation by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Parent, Vice President and Treasurer, Quebecor Inc., QMI and Videotron\n\n8. Customer acquisition cost (CAC)\n\nCustomer acquisition cost tracks the average amount of money spent on sales and marketing to obtain each new customer.\n\nThis metric provides a partial way to track the ROI of social media, marketing, and sales teams. In an ideal situation, as teams scale their efforts, CAC should go down, and ROI should go up.\n\nThe formula for CAC is straightforward: The amount spent on sales and marketing over a given period divided by the number of customers acquired in the same timeframe:\n\nCAC = Sales and marketing spend / customers acquired\n\nFor example, if you spent $10,000 on sales and marketing and acquired 20,000 customers, your cost per acquisition is 50 cents.\n\nA lower amount is a better result\u2014but it could also mean you have a low sales and marketing budget. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to view this figure in tandem with customer service satisfaction metrics and growth and performance results.\n\n9. Customer lifetime value (CLV)\n\nCustomer lifetime value is a measure of how much you can expect to earn from a single customer over the entire lifetime of their relationship with your brand.\n\nCLV that\u2019s higher than the average initial purchase means that customers make multiple purchases from your company over time. That indicates a healthy brand relationship and great brand loyalty.\n\nIn order to measure CLV, you\u2019ll need to have a few data points about customer behavior.\n\nCLV = Average purchase value x Average purchase frequency x Average customer lifespan\n\nFor example, one research analyst estimated Amazon\u2019s customer lifetime value as $2,283 from Prime members and $916 for non-Prime members.\n\nThis is also an important metric for understanding how much you can afford to spend on social media advertising to acquire a new customer.\n\n10. Recurring revenue\n\nRecurring revenue is another way to measure how many of your customers are sticking around. It can also give you a sense of whether people are upgrading or downgrading their recurring level of spend.\n\nYou can measure recurring revenue on any time period that aligns with the renewal/notice period for your subscription products or services. The most common options are monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and annualized recurring revenue (ARR).\n\nTo measure MRR, multiply your number of active users by the average monthly revenue per user.\n\nMRR = Number of active users x Average monthly revenue per user\n\n11. Expansion revenue\n\nThe recurring revenue metric above measures how much you\u2019re bringing in on a recurring basis. Expansion revenue measures how much revenue comes from upgrades, premium products, and so on. This is a great measure of customer success because it indicates customers are willing to spend more than the basic amount required to access your service.\n\nTo calculate expansion revenue, tally all the revenue brought in from add-ons, upgrades, and so on.\n\nTo calculate expansion revenue per user, divide the total by the number of users.\n\nExpansion revenue per user = Total revenue from adds-ons and upgrades/Number of users\n\n12. Revenue contraction\n\nRevenue contraction is the opposite of expansion revenue. In this case, you\u2019re measuring how much revenue is lost from downgrades. This is similar to churn in that it indicates people are not seeing success with their premium plans.\n\nChurn measures how many customers you lose entirely. Revenue contraction measures how much income you lose from customers who stick around but downgrade their plan.\n\nOne interesting example of revenue contraction comes from streaming services, many of which have recently introduced ad-supported lower-cost plans. Research from analysis company Antenna shows that downgrades from an ad-free plan represented 29% of new additions to the ad-plan offering over the first 13 months.\n\nSource: Antenna\n\nKeep in mind that while HBO MAx loses subscription money from these downgrades, they gain ad revenue. So it\u2019s not a straight income loss. But it is still a good measure of the value customers place on premium versus basic plans.\n\nTo calculate revenue contraction, tally all the revenue lost from downgrades. To calculate contraction per user, divide the total by the number of users.\n\nRevenue contraction per user = Total revenue lost from downgrades/Number of users\n\n13. Average revenue per user (ARPU)\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a subscription model, you don\u2019t necessarily have recurring revenue. But it\u2019s still important to keep an eye on how your average customer spend is changing over time. Customers who are experiencing success with your brand will generally spend more, while those who are less satisfied will spend less.\n\nTo measure ARPU, divide your total revenue over a period by your average number of active users over that period.\n\nARPU = Total revenue/Number of active users\n\nSince ARPU is such an important measure of brand health, it often appears in earnings and investor reports.\n\nSource: Meta Earnings Presentation Q1 2023\n\n14. Average response time\n\nAverage response time tracks how long it takes for customers to first hear from a support agent \u2014 it essentially measures the wait times involved in speaking with your team.\n\nA short reply time is a mark of good customer service, especially online, where customers pretty much expect service on-demand. For this reason, many companies rely on bots to handle initial queries.\n\nThere are plenty of automation tools, such as Hootsuite Inbox, that provide average ticket handling time reports.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to calculate it manually, use the following formula:\n\nAverage response time = Total time taken for first response to customer queries / Number of queries\n\n15. Average resolution time\n\nAverage resolution time measures how long it takes for customer tickets to be resolved. For a customer and an organization, the sooner customer issues can be resolved, the better.\n\nIf you receive a high volume of customer queries, the more necessary it is to use tools to calculate resolution times accurately. Here\u2019s how to calculate it manually:\n\nAverage resolution time = Total time spent on resolved cases / number of resolved cases\n\nAnother key customer service performance metric is first contact resolution rate. Customers don\u2019t like to be passed from one agent to another. Not only does this reflect poorly on the organization, it also often leads to longer resolution times.\n\nIf you have a low first contact resolution rate, chances are you\u2019ll also have a high customer effort score (CES). Especially if the customer is asked to explain their issue more than once.\n\nLike average response rate and resolution time, many platforms automatically calculate this for you. Here\u2019s the manual formula, just in case:\n\nFirst contact resolution rate = Number of cases resolved with one agent / number of resolved cases\n\n17. Overall resolution rate\n\nNot all cases end with a happy resolution. That\u2019s normal. But a good resolution rate should always be the goal.\n\nHere\u2019s how to calculate your overall resolution rate:\n\n\u200b\u200bOverall resolution rate = Number of resolved cases / number of unresolved cases\n\nIf your resolution rate is low, it\u2019s necessary to do a little more digging\u2014especially if your customer retention rate (CRR) is low as well. Get more granular by looking to see if there\u2019s a specific ticket category that\u2019s bringing your overall resolution rate down and develop relevant solutions.\n\n18. Preferred communication channels\n\nIn order to deliver top-rate customer service, it\u2019s necessary to know where customers expect to receive support.\n\nKeep track of the methods and platforms customers use to contact your businesses so you can allocate resources accordingly. For example, if you receive a high volume of support requests on Twitter, it may be time to open a customer service Twitter account.\n\nFree customer service report template\n\nWe designed a simple customer service report template in Google Sheets to help you keep track of your customer service efforts month by month. To use or customize this template, go to \u201cFile\u201d and \u201cMake a copy\u201d first.\n\nThe first tab has a tracker for all your primary and secondary customer service metrics.\n\nThe second tab contains a ticket volume tracker, visualized in a line graph where you can easily see which type of tickets you get the most of and identify any rising problem categories or spikes. You can also use this chart to communicate with the product team if, for example, you see spikes in returns, technical issues, or product availability.\n\nThe third tab contains all the formulas and definitions you will need to fill out your report, almost like a customer service metrics calculator.

The free resource includes recommended photo dimensions for every type of image on every major network.\n\nHow do AI art generators work?\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of AI art prompt tips, it\u2019s important to understand how AI art generators work. First off, generative AI applications are robots, not humans. That might seem obvious, but it\u2019s important to remember that these generators don\u2019t understand the world like you do.\n\nAI art generators don\u2019t know what an owl looks like in the wild. They don\u2019t know what a sunset looks like in a physical sense. They can only understand details about features, patterns, and relationships within the datasets they\u2019ve been trained on.\n\nPrompting for a \u201cbeautiful face\u201d is not very helpful. It is more effective to prompt for specific features such as symmetry, big lips, and green eyes. Even if the bot doesn\u2019t understand beauty, it can recognize the features you describe as beautiful and generate something relatively accurate.\n\nTo get the best results from your AI art generator prompt, you\u2019ll need to give clear and detailed instructions. An effective AI art prompt should include specific descriptions, shapes, colors, textures, patterns, and artistic styles. This allows the neural networks used by the generator to create the best possible visuals.\n\nHow to write an AI art prompt\n\nNow that you know how AI art generators work, it\u2019s time to start crafting your prompts. Here are a few tips and tricks you can use when writing good AI art prompts.\n\n1. Describe the content of your image\n\nWhen writing an AI art prompt, you\u2019ll want to be as descriptive as possible about the content of your image. Is it a drawing, sketch, or 3D rendering? Should it look like a photograph, or is something more illustrated?\n\nTry starting your prompt like this:\n\nA photograph of\u2026\n\nA 3D rendering of\u2026\n\nA sketch of\u2026\n\nAn illustration of\u2026\n\n2. Describe the subject\n\nAll AI art prompts should include a description of the subject you want to create. This could be anything from a person, animal, or object to an abstract concept or emotion. Get as specific with your descriptions as possible so the AI generator knows what to look for in its datasets.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn illustration of an owl\u2026\n\nA photograph of a president\u2026\n\nA 3D rendering of a chair\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s a Midjourney AI art prompt for: \u201cAn illustration of an owl.\u201d\n\n3. Add relevant details\n\nNext, add detail to your prompt by including relevant information about the elements of your image. This could include anything from colors, color palettes, shapes, sizes, and textures.\n\nIf you want to generate an image of a bear, don\u2019t just say \u201cbear.\u201d Explain what kind of bear it is (brown and black, grizzly or polar), its surroundings (a forest or mountain range), and any other interesting details.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes\u2026\n\nA photograph of a president wearing a navy suit\u2026\n\nA 3D rendering of a chair that\u2019s round and yellow\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s an AI art prompt example from Midjourney for: \u201cAn illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes.\u201d\n\n4. Describe the form and style\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to provide details about the form and style of your AI art. This is especially important if you\u2019re looking for a specific visual effect. For example, you might include keywords such as \u201cabstract,\u201d \u201cminimalist,\u201d or \u201csurreal\u201d to convey a certain artistic feel.\n\nTry this:\n\nAn illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism\u2026\n\nA photograph of a president wearing a navy suit with a minimalist look\u2026\n\nA 3D rendering of a chair that\u2019s round and yellow in the style of cubism\u2026\n\nYou can also use a specific artist\u2019s name here to mimic their style. For instance, say, \u201cLike Salvador Dali.\u201d Or, mention an artist\u2019s specific artwork, like \u201cLike Andy Warhol\u2019s Shot Marilyns painting.\u201d\n\nHere is the Midjourney result for \u201cAn illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism.\u201d\n\n5. Define the composition\n\nFinally, you can use keywords to define the composition of your image. This includes things like resolution, lighting style, aspect ratio, and camera view.\n\nFor example:\n\nAn illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism with volumetric lighting.\n\nA photograph of a president wearing a navy suit with a minimalist look taken from an aerial viewpoint.\n\nA 3D rendering of a chair that\u2019s round and yellow in the style of cubism with a resolution of 4096 x 2160.\n\nHere is the Midjourney result for: \u201cAn illustration of a red owl with bright blue eyes in the style of abstract expressionism with volumetric lighting.\u201d\n\nWith these examples, you can see how each image changes as the prompt evolves.\n\nAdditional AI art prompt tips to consider\n\nHere are a few additional tips to keep in mind when generating AI art from prompts.\n\nUse keywords that the AI generator can understand. Don\u2019t use overly complicated or uncommon words, as the AI\u2019s neural networks won\u2019t be able to recognize them.\n\nDon\u2019t use overly complicated or uncommon words, as the AI\u2019s neural networks won\u2019t be able to recognize them. Keep your prompts short and sweet. While having at least 3 to 7 words in an AI art prompt is recommended, don\u2019t overwhelm the system by being overly descriptive.\n\nWhile having at least 3 to 7 words in an AI art prompt is recommended, don\u2019t overwhelm the system by being overly descriptive. Adjectives are your best friend! Use multiple adjectives to describe your art\u2019s subject, style, and composition.\n\nUse multiple adjectives to describe your art\u2019s subject, style, and composition. Avoid conflicting terms that have opposite meanings. For example, using both \u201crealistic\u201d and \u201cabstract\u201d to describe the style of your AI art will likely confuse the generator.\n\nFor example, using both \u201crealistic\u201d and \u201cabstract\u201d to describe the style of your AI art will likely confuse the generator. Use other AI copywriting tools , like ChatGPT, as AI art prompt generators. Why not let the robots do the work?\n\nWhy not let the robots do the work? Research the specific tool you\u2019re using to find out what keywords it can recognize. Tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Bing Image Creator all work a little differently.

It\u2019s seriously easy. Start free 30-day trial\n\nAI art tool comparisons\n\nFinding the right AI art generator for your project can be tricky. To help your process, let\u2019s compare Midjourney, DALL-E, and Bing Image Creator. This will help you decide which is best suited to your needs.\n\nMidjourney\n\nMidjourney is an AI tool that creates pictures from words. Users can change the image size, shape, view, and more. Midjourney is known for its photo-realism images, as well as hyperrealistic images.\n\nMidjourney also operates in a Discord chatroom. You can see how others create AI art prompts and get inspired by their work.\n\nKeep in mind your first 25 images on Midjourney are free. But after that, basic plans start at $10 per month.\n\nSome tips for using Midjourney:\n\nWords at the start of the prompt hold more weight than words at the end.\n\nMidjourney particularly likes artist references, so feel free to include them in your prompt.\n\nSome of the most effective Midjourney keywords include: Fashion photography, Pulitzer Prize-winning photography, Bokeh, Volumetric Lighting, Golden Hour, Soft natural lighting, and Film gain. Find more here.\n\nHere\u2019s a Midjourney example for: \u201cA Dadaist collage of a post-apocalyptic world in neon tones and volumetric lighting.\u201d\n\nDALL-E is a great AI art generator trained on the concept of \u201cimagination.\u201d It creates surreal dreamscapes and can interpret creative concepts as well as abstract ideas. The images DALL-E produces often have a unique, otherworldly feel to them.\n\nUnlike Midjourney, DALL-E focuses more on creative prompts and less on photorealistic images. It also follows word prompts closely and has an intuitive interface, giving new users a relatively low learning curve. DALL-E gives you 50 free credits upfront and then 15 more each month you use the service. But, those that use the tool beyond their free prompt limit will need to pay $15 for every additional 115 prompts.\n\nSome tips for using DALL-E:\n\nDALL-E works best with specified art styles. Try styles like digital art, steampunk art, cyberpunk art, or vapourware art.\n\nAs a faithful prompt follower, DALL-E enjoys descriptive prompts. Add adjectives like dark, light, epic, sad, or happy to improve your results.\n\nDALL-E often leaves the background white if you don\u2019t specify a color. To add a backdrop, include keywords like \u201cin Paris\u201d or \u201cin the woods at night\u201d to your prompt.\n\nWe used the same AI art prompt from our Midjourney test, \u200b\u200b\u201dA Dadaist collage of a post-apocalyptic world in neon tones and volumetric lighting,\u201d in DALL-E.\n\nHere\u2019s what we got:\n\nDifferent, right?\n\nBing Image Creator\n\nWhereas Midjourney focuses on photorealism, and DALL-E emphasizes creative concepts, the Bing Image Creator specializes in vibrance and detail.\n\nBing Image Creator struggles a bit with facial features, fine detail, and consistency of style.

Here's how they work.\n\nRecent changes to API access on Twitter and Reddit have brought the topic of social media APIs into the news.\n\nAPIs power many of the tools and features we use every day in apps and marketing tools \u2014 but they\u2019re essentially invisible to everyone but developers. So, what do you need to know about APIs as a social media user or professional?\n\nIn this post, we cover everything you need to know about social media APIs to understand how they affect the online tools we use every day.\n\nWhat is a social media API?\n\nAPI stands for application programming interface. A social media API is a piece of code that allows social media networks to integrate with third-party apps and tools \u2014 for example, social media management tools like Hootsuite.\n\nAt its heart, an API is a communications channel. Different programs use it to \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and share data in real time. As such, social media APIs allow developers to create apps and services that extend the functionality of social media platforms.\n\nEveryone wins. The social media platforms benefit from this additional functionality without having to build new features themselves. Developers benefit by building new for-profit apps. And users benefit by gaining access to the functions developers create using API data access.\n\nHow do social media APIs work?\n\nA social media API works by connecting social media platforms with external tools and apps. It gives external developers access to certain kinds of data that social media-related tools require to work.\n\nAll popular social media networks have APIs that developers can use to create social media management tools. You can dig into details on each network\u2019s site for developers:\n\nHow does this work in practice? Social media tools like Hootsuite have seamless integrations with all major social networks based on API access. The APIs connect Hootsuite with your social media accounts. Thanks to them, you can manage all your social accounts from one centralized dashboard rather than switching between tabs to handle profiles on different platforms separately. This includes scheduling and publishing posts, putting together analytics reports, replying to messages and comments, and so on.\n\nNetworks decide how much social media data their APIs give developers access to. That means apps and other tools that help you manage your social media accounts have to play by the rules set out by the social platforms. That\u2019s why connecting social accounts to a third-party tool for the first time can be cumbersome \u2014 social platforms will typically ask you to confirm your consent to share data before granting initial access through their API.\n\nThe social media APIs also dictate what features third-party tools can \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 provide. Does it seem like your social media management tools are making you jump through hoops to accomplish a task? It\u2019s likely because they are working around the limitations of a social platform\u2019s API.\n\nFor example, Instagram has two main APIs. The Instagram Basic Display API allows developers to create consumer-level apps (e.g. apps that allow users to feature their Instagram feed on their website). These only require basic access to an Instagram account.\n\nThe Instagram Graph API provides greater functionality. It\u2019s intended for apps that allow professional Instagram accounts to manage their entire Instagram presence \u2014 like Hootsuite.\n\nWhat are the different types of social media APIs?\n\nOpen APIs\n\nSource: Camwilliams96, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nOpen APIs are publicly available interfaces. These are also sometimes called public APIs or a free social media API.\n\nGenerally, these don\u2019t provide access to proprietary or copyrighted data. Instead, they are designed to help developers make use of data that is publicly available.\n\nFor example, the Google Maps JavaScript API allows anyone to create a map with a specific place marker and embed it on their website. This is a custom use of data already publicly available in Google Maps.\n\nHere\u2019s what the code would look like for a basic webpage with a custom map created using the Maps JavaScript API:\n\nSource: Google Maps Platform\n\nDevelopers might need to register for access or authentication to use open APIs. In the example above, you can see the API key, which is a form of authentication. The other form of authentication sometimes required for open APIs is called an OAuth.\n\nTo use the Facebook APIs, for example, developers need to create a developer account. Before an app using the Facebook APIs goes live, the developer must add a verified business to the app. They also have to answer some questions about their data handling practices. The app then goes into review.\n\nPartner APIs\n\nPartner APIs are only available to approved business partners. Before developers get access to the API, they need to apply for approval. Then, they are granted a specific type of access in the form of a license or a rights agreement.\n\nSince these APIs provide access to data that is not publicly available, they are much more limited in use. They are usually restricted to performing one specific task. Authentication is usually required in the form of an access token.\n\nInternal APIs\n\nInternal APIs are used to help different systems within one social network work better together. They provide access to backend data for developers who either work for the company or have been contracted by the company. These are not accessible to outside developers. These are also sometimes called private APIs.\n\nAre social media APIs secure?\n\nOne of the main benefits of APIs is that they use various security protocols to protect information as it is transferred between applications.\n\nRemember, the \u201cI\u201d in API stands for \u201cinterface.\u201d The interface works like a middleman between applications and your devices. The applications only share the information they need to perform specific tasks.\n\nAPIs provide users choice in what data is made available to third-party tools. For example, when you grant an app or tool like Hootsuite access to your LinkedIn account, you\u2019ll see a screen asking you which data you want to share. You can also edit this access at any time from the Settings & Privacy menu on your LinkedIn profile.\n\nBut even with these guardrails, APIs definitely do have vulnerabilities, since they create a potential data access point for bad actors. Hackers exploited vulnerabilities in Facebook\u2019s APIs in a massive breach in 2018. An API vulnerability also resulted in a Twitter hack in 2022.\n\nAPIs are critical to social media platform functionality \u2014 so social media companies are consistently working to improve security. On the user side, it\u2019s a good idea to limit your use of third-party social media apps to those that have their own security protocols in place.\n\n6 more interesting facts about social media APIs\n\n1. Social media APIs power interactive chatbots\n\nAPIs are the connecting force that allow personalized, interactive, and AI-powered chatbots to run on social media platforms. Have you ever interacted with a chatbot on Facebook Messenger? That conversation was made possible by the Facebook Messenger API.\n\n2.Social media APIs from different platforms can be used together\n\nEach social network has its own API(s). But developers can use those APIs in combination to create tools that provide functionality for multiple social networks. This makes life much easier for anyone who has more than one social media account.\n\nFor example, each social platform has its own native analytics information. You can access the analytics for each of your accounts by logging into the account and navigating the the analytics tab. But an API-powered management tool like Hootsuite uses analytics APIs from multiple social platforms. This provides an analytics tool that shows results from multiple platforms all on one screen.\n\n3. Social media APIs have generally been free\u2014but Twitter recently changed that\n\nStarting February 9, we will no longer support free access to the Twitter API, both v2 and v1.1. A paid basic tier will be available instead \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 2, 2023\n\nTwitter sparked major debate about the use of APIs in February 2023, when they announced their free API access would be shut down. In May they launched API tiered access pricing:\n\nFree for \u201cwrite-only use cases and testing the Twitter API\u201d\n\n$100/month for \u201chobbyists or prototypes\u201d\n\n$5,000/month for \u201cstartups scaling their business\u201d\n\nAnd reportedly up to $42,000/month for \u201cbusinesses and scaled commercial projects\u201d\n\nReddit soon followed suit. They announced that commercial API access would require a significant monthly fee.\n\nThis has led to the shutdown of many smaller third-party apps for Twitter and Reddit. It remains to be seen if this trend will continue to other social platforms.\n\n4. Social media platforms continue to create new APIs\n\nAs social platforms build new functionality, they need to create and release new APIs.\n\nFor example, Meta added an Instagram Reels API in late June 2002. They followed up with a Reels API for Facebook in September. In May 2023, Meta added Instagram Stories to the Instagram Content Publishing API. This resulted in announcements like this:\n\n5. Social media APIs could help prevent chronic disease or improve disaster response\n\nSocial media APIs provide valuable information for researchers that can be used for the public good\u2014such as preventing chronic disease or getting early warning about natural disasters.\n\nFor example, the World Health Organization created a pilot project to gather COVID-19 data from public online conversations, including through social media monitoring API. Other researchers analyzed data related to nicotine poisoning using TikTok hashtags and APIs.\n\nThe latest proposal is to develop a system to help prevent chronic disease by identifying potential risk factors based on information collected through social media APIs.\n\nSource: Diana Braga et al. / Procedia Computer Science 220 (2023) 820\u2013825\n\nResearchers have also suggested that data gathered from social media APIs could help governments and rescue organizations better understand what\u2019s happening on the ground in disaster areas so they can improve their response.\n\n6. LinkedIn has adopted an API-first approach\n\nThis is an interesting indication of how much value LinkedIn sees in the tools created by third party developers. In the summer of 2022, they began versioning their Marketing APIs.\n\nAs part of this change to their API platform, they determined that new features would launch on the partner API at the same time as they launched on the LinkedIn user interface. In some cases, they would actually launch first on the partner API.\n\nSave time managing your social media presence with Hootsuite.

Here's how to build a compliant social media archiving strategy.\n\nSocial media archiving for government is a critical component of compliance planning. Social channels are a forum for communicating with constituents and the general public. They are subject to open records and First Amendment laws, just like any other public communication.\n\nContent posted on government social media pages is, by default, publically accessible. But open records laws require a much more thorough archiving of data than the social platforms themselves can provide. Agencies must ensure their social content is archived for access by citizens and journalists. Keep reading to find out how to stay compliant with a smart archiving workflow.\n\n#1 Social Media Tool for Government Engage citizens with the only tool that makes it easy to communicate, deliver services, and manage crises. Book a Demo\n\nWhat is social media archiving for government agencies?\n\nSocial media archiving for government agencies is a component of open records laws. Social media is a public forum, and must be archived as such.\n\nA proper archive of your social media content and communication also allows you to respond to public records and freedom of information requests. You also need archived social comments if you are faced with a First Amendment challenge.\n\nHow is social media archiving regulated in the government sector?\n\nSocial media archiving regulations vary by country, and even by state. The common component is that social media is generally considered a public record.\n\nGovernment organizations and agencies need to maintain an archive of social media content. That includes all comments and conversations. This information needs to be accessible to citizens and journalists who request it.\n\nThe requirements for archiving are quite specific and can include:\n\nCollecting social media metadata\n\nMaintaining a record of content in its original format\n\nKeeping social media records for s specific period of time\n\nArchiving comments even if they are deleted or hidden\n\nMaintaining a contextual record of all comments threads\n\nMaintaining data in a specific geographic location\n\nEach jurisdiction also has its own privacy regulations. These impact what government agencies can post on social media. For example, the Government of British Columbia has Guidelines for Government Use of Social Media. These specify that the following topics are off-limits:\n\nAnything currently going through the court system\n\nConfidential information like policy advice and draft legislation\n\nInformation about identifiable third parties without statutory authorization\n\nCitizen engagement can encourage people to share personal information on social media. This is especially true when people share photos. This is a particularly important area to consider when thinking about data collection and archiving.\n\nHow to archive records on social media and stay compliant\n\nSocial media compliance is an ongoing challenge for all government agencies. Especially for those involved in active citizen engagement.\n\nYou need a comprehensive strategy for social media archiving. This ensures you have all the records you need to:\n\ncomply with legislation\n\nrespond to FOI requests,\n\naddress First Amendment challenges, and\n\nimprove transparency in government.\n\nSet up archiving policies and procedures\n\nLike any good compliance strategy, your archiving system must be built on a solid foundation. Your archiving policies and procedures are the supports upon which all of your recordkeeping is built.\n\nAs you build your policies, do a thorough review of the legislation applicable in your jurisdiction to make sure you comply with every detail.\n\nFor example, Australia\u2019s privacy and public data policies require social content to be archived in Australian data centers. That means Australian government agencies can only work with archiving solutions that have data storage options within Australia \u2013 like Brolly, which is built into Hootsuite.\n\nBuild your archiving policies and procedures into your overall social media guidelines. That way, all staff who deal with social media have easy access to your most current policies at all times.\n\nBonus: Get a free, customizable social media guidelines template to quickly and easily create recommendations for your company and employees.\n\nBe sure to include a clear process for approving new social media accounts. The more accounts your agency uses, the more you need to archive. Does every department need its own social channels? Perhaps they do, but there should be a strategic purpose for each new account. Before any new account goes live, make sure to add it to your archiving process.\n\nCapture and preserve all social media content\n\nLike we said above, social media content is considered part of the public record. That includes ALL social media communication on or with your social channels.\n\nYou might wonder why you need a special archive of your social media content. After all, it\u2019s publically available on your social accounts. But social media platforms themselves are private-sector companies. They are not subject to open records laws. That means there\u2019s no guarantee the social platforms will preserve your content forever.\n\nPlus, if you ever delete or edit content, you need to keep a record of those changes. Open records laws require you to archive every version or every post presented to the public.\n\nYou also need a record of all comments made on your social accounts. That applies even if you have to delete or hide those comments for reasons like:\n\nidentifying information,\n\nthreats of violence,\n\nprofanity,\n\nand so on.\n\nYou also have to consider that people might delete or edit their own comments. You still need them in your archive. Without an archiving solution, you have no way to retrieve a constituent comment that they delete from your page.\n\nIn addition to open records laws, you need to protect your organization in case of a First Amendment challenge. That means you need an archive of all deleted or hidden comments\n\nComments posted to official government agency social accounts generally fall under First Amendment protections. Your social media policy should include an acceptable use policy that indicates what types of comments may be deleted and why. Your archive then allows you to prove there was cause for removal.\n\nYou should even keep a record of all content in which you are tagged or mentioned, since this can count as communication. Monitoring content in which you\u2019re tagged or mentioned is a best practice for all social media users. It\u2019s an important way to understand the conversation about you online. For government agencies, it\u2019s critical.\n\nIn other words, you need purpose-built social media archiving tools for government. This is the only way to fully archive the conversation with constituents and comply with the law.\n\nAs a side note, social\u2019s designation as a public record means you cannot block people from following your government agency social accounts. Archiving is one part of compliance with public records laws, but it\u2019s by no means the whole picture. Check out our detailed blog post for everything you need to know about compliance for government agencies using social media.\n\nFree Webinar for Government Agencies Grow on social media while avoiding security and compliance risks. Learn how to connect with your constituents, collect feedback, respond to crises, and more. Watch now\n\nInclude metadata and contextual information\n\nOpen records legislation in many jurisdictions requires you to preserve social media content with metadata and contextual information. For example, U.S. courts have generally found that screenshots alone are not a sufficient record of a comments thread.\n\nWhy? Because a screenshot is just an image, and images can be edited. That\u2019s why social media archiving for government must include metadata and contextual information.\n\nLet\u2019s look at metadata first. Metadata is not visible on a social media page. But it lives in the background of all online content. Metadata captures information about every post and comment, including:\n\nWho posted it\n\nExactly when they posted it (timestamp)\n\nWhat device they used\n\nThat means you can see, for example, if one person uses multiple accounts to post multiple comments from the same device. More importantly, all of this metadata together allows your agency to prove that the records in your archive are authentic. It shows they are complete and have not been modified. Without metadata, a social media archive file is unlikely to be accepted in court.\n\nContextual information captures the context in which a comment is made. Context is important because it helps capture the full intent of what was posted. Content can also provide insight into why a comment had to be deleted or hidden.\n\nFor example, a standalone comment might appear to have no reason for deletion. But what about in the content of a comments thread? If constituents are responding to one another, that comment might be seen to provide identifiable information about a third party that violates privacy regulations, or to indicate a threat to another commenter.\n\nAn archive with complete metadata and contextual information allows you to reconstruct an entire social media conversation. You\u2019ll have details and content that would otherwise be lost.\n\nMake archived content accessible and searchable\n\nThe whole point of archiving open records information is that you can access it and provide it to citizens or journalists that submit a freedom of information request. For that to work, your archive needs to be secure but easily accessible by the appropriate members of your team.\n\nIt also needs to be searchable so that you can find all relevant content when it\u2019s requested. Social media archiving tools for government should include advanced search capabilities. You should be able to find content from a specific date range, using specific keywords or user data. The ability to tag content and add notes within the archive also comes in handy when you need to retrieve social content.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s important that you can access hidden or deleted content and comments. This is especially true in case of a First Amendment challenge. The full context is important to validate any decisions about removing public commentary from your page.\n\nFailure to comply with a freedom of information request or legal challenge can have serious legal and financial consequences. A complete and easy-to-use archive helps protect your agency from lawsuits and other punitive action.\n\nThe bonus? A detailed, searchable archive helps you understand comment and question trends. These may reveal that you need to create more resources around a specific program or policy.\n\nFree Course for Government Agencies Take this free 45-minute course and become an expert in government social media.

Social media legislation doesn\u2019t move quite as quickly, but you can\u2019t assume it will stay the same forever. And the tools available to archive social media content and improve compliance continue to evolve.\n\nThat means you need to review your archiving process regularly. You can choose what \u201cregularly\u201d means to your organization, but plan for a thorough social media audit at least quarterly.\n\nFor government agencies, that social media audit should include an audit of your archiving process and procedures.\n\nMake sure any new social media accounts have been added to your archiving system. Review the archiving policies and procedures with staff both old and new. Assign someone on your team to monitor any changes in legislation. Be sure to voice these at the regular reviews if they have not yet been addressed.\n\nSocial media archiving with Hootsuite\n\nWhen choosing your social media archiving tools for government compliance, it\u2019s important to work with a trusted and secure vendor.

No tricks or boring tips\u2014just simple, easy-to-follow instructions that really work.\n\nWhat is brand reputation?\n\nBrand reputation is the widespread opinion the public shares about your brand.\n\nAre you reliable? Are you hilarious? Are you snobby? Is your spokes-candy smokin\u2019 hot? What, exactly, are people quietly thinking \u2014 or not-so-quietly tweeting \u2014 about your brand and product?\n\nFor instance: Patagonia is beloved for its commitment to the environment (it even landed at #3 on the 2022 Axios-Harris poll of the most reputable brands in America).\n\nIn a perfect world, your reputation is based on your past behavior or actions \u2014 but sometimes, one wrong move can turn the world against you. (Or even worse, untrue rumors can spread and poison an otherwise pristine public record.)\n\nWhat people think of you as a person may or may not matter to you (for example, if you are Joan Jett), but when it comes to your brand, your rep is everything.\n\nNearly 75% of customers count on word-of-mouth to inform their purchases\n\n92% of business-to-business decision-makers rely on trusted reviews for purchases\n\nEven a 5% improvement in reputation can yield a 2.5% revenue growth\n\nA good reputation can help with recruiting and retention, too: the majority of U.S. candidates won\u2019t work for a company with a bad rep. On the flip side, people are downright clamoring to apply for Gainsight, which was named the #1 best place to work by employee-review site Glassdoor in 2023.\n\nIn other words, a business that has a reputation for being trustworthy and authentic is going to thrive.\n\nNo wonder internationally beloved toy company Lego reported a 17% growth in 2022. Meanwhile, Wish, one of the brands that was featured lower on last year\u2019s Axios-Harris poll, reported a net loss of $384 million that same year.\n\nSource: Axios\n\nYour brand\u2019s reputation is impacted by many different factors, such as:\n\nThe quality and relevance of your products or services\n\nHow you interact with customers or potential clients\n\nThe brand values you promote (in words or actions)\n\nHow you handle a crisis or mistake\n\nYour employees\u2019 or partners\u2019 behavior\n\nThe working conditions of your office or production facility\n\nThe content of your social media accounts, ad campaigns, or creative productions\n\nBasically, any touchpoint you have with the public \u2014 online or offline \u2014 is an opportunity for judgment.\n\nThe good news? You don\u2019t necessarily have to sit back and accept public sentiment. You can be an active participant in cultivating and defending your brand.\n\nWhether you\u2019re beloved by the world or loathed, social media is a vital tool for both shaping and managing your reputation. (And if you don\u2019t have social media accounts for your business set up yet\u2026 what the heck are you waiting for? Here are 22 reasons you\u2019ve got to get your brand online, ASAP.)\n\n10 top brand reputation management strategies\n\n1. Build your brand awareness\n\nIt\u2019s hard to build a great reputation if no one knows about you.\n\nFor instance, did you know Neil Young had his own brand of MP3 player? And are you surprised at all to hear that it didn\u2019t go super well?\n\nBrand awareness is a measure of how well people recognize your brand, including how \u201caware\u201d they are that your product or business exists at all.\n\nRather than a simple individual metric, brand awareness is a concept that touches on many different KPIs, from traffic to social share of voice.\n\nDevelop your brand aesthetics and voice, follow best practices for social media, and make sure to be on your best behavior as you grow that audience.\n\nWendy\u2019s currently has 3.9 million followers on Twitter, because the social media managers have done such a spectacular job of building the brand\u2019s digital reputation.\n\nThe account showcases a snarky, silly brand voice that has delighted the internet and captured the attention of millions. (Competitor burger resto Arby\u2019s, comparatively, has 80,000 followers. No shade, just respect to the big W.)\n\nLearn more about building brand awareness here\n\n2. Keep your brand consistent\n\nStrong reputations are built on consistency. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t have fun with your content (surprise \u2018em with a livestream, why don\u2019t you?), but rather that your audience should be able to depend on you to deliver great content, products and services with no hiccups.\n\nTakis delivers absolutely unhinged recipes regularly on TikTok, for instance. Whether you\u2019d want to eat a \u201ccrazy cucumber\u201d or not, it\u2019s comforting to know what to expect from the playful snack food brand.\n\nThe trick to consistent, engaging social media posts starts with a style guide.\n\nA social media content calendar can help here, too \u2014 and don\u2019t forget to schedule your posts for consistent, dependable appearances in your fans\u2019 feeds.\n\n3. Create social guidelines and a crisis management plan\n\nAvoiding social media snafus starts with coming up with your own guidelines to follow in times of crisis. Chaos reigns when we let emotions rule our Twitter accounts.\n\nCrafting a set of best practices for your social media accounts and a crisis management plan ensures your brand has a set of guidelines for how to behave in a worst case scenario. Thinking ahead about how to respond when a troll or PR nightmare comes along will help your brand appear as level-headed as possible if trouble starts brewing.\n\n4. Contribute to your community\n\nThe best reputations don\u2019t just come from carefully managing your tone and image \u2014 they come from offering genuine value to your community and cultivating connections.\n\nHershey has partnered with the Mmusic Initiative and uses its social platform to showcase the organization\u2019s work. Pretty sweet move. (Because it\u2019s a candy company? And also a nice thing to do? You get it, you get it.)\n\nHow can you brand give back and participate? How can your brand be generous and helpful to everyone else? Try creating a Facebook group for your fans. Respond to comments with respect and warmth.

Approach partnerships with caution\n\nPartnering up with other brands, influencers and ambassadors can be an amazing opportunity to get creative and spread the word about your brand. But teaming up with anyone means that you might catch heat for any of their mistakes.\n\nA little research before you partner with another organization or person is always a good idea. Do their past posts align with your values? Have they been the subject of any controversy or drama that might put your company on the defensive?\n\nJust because someone has a lot of followers doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the right ambassador for your brand.\n\n6. Practice social listening\n\nWhether someone\u2019s totally trashing you or signing your praises, you\u2019re going to want to know.\n\nSet up Hootsuite Streams to catch all the hot goss, right on your dashboard.

Can\u2019t even speak to a person on the phone. #airlines #frontier #customerexperience \u2014 Scott Thomas (@sthomas311) April 30, 2023\n\nBut if you treat people well when they have a problem, your customer loyalty will be through the roof.\n\nAn Inbox management tool like Hootsuite Inbox may be known as a customer service tool, but it\u2019s really a reputation management tool at its heart.\n\nWhy?

And we may be biased, but Hootsuite Insights is our favorite option here.\n\nPowered by Brandwatch, Insights allows you to use detailed Boolean search strings to monitor social sentiment automatically.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get word clouds showing the most common words used to talk about your brand.

Build a social advocacy program\n\nOne great way to get people talking about you is to\u2026 ask them to talk about you.\n\nA social advocacy program rewards folks who are singing your praises out there on the world-wide web.

Share user-generated content\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is original, brand-specific content created by customers and published on social media or other channels. UGC acts as a trust signal, taking your brand authenticity to the next level.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly influential in shaping the perception of your brand on the market. People see other folks loving your tee shirts, and they start to believe that you\u2019re making something special. Put more plainly: use peer pressure to your advantage!\n\nNike Running reshares posts from people who tag the brand, which leads to a (nice for Nike) vicious cycle of other people wanting to post their own content to be featured so they can be part of a cool, exclusive club.\n\nNike Running obviously isn\u2019t posting anyone complaining about blisters\u2026 so there\u2019s absolutely an incentive to keep public comments positive if you want some of that sweet, sweet Nike attention, right?\n\nLearn more about cultivating and sharing user-generated content here.\n\n10. Practice brand safety\n\nBrand safety means ensuring that a business\u2019s ads aren\u2019t associated with inappropriate content that could damage the brand\u2019s reputation.\n\nThis includes creating policies and measures to protect the brand from appearing alongside content that could be offensive, controversial, illegal or unethical.\n\nBrand safety is most often discussed in the context of paid ads. That\u2019s because social media ads can be a big investment \u2014 but they can also pose a serious risk.\n\nRead more about avoiding brand safety risks here.\n\nHow to measure brand reputation\n\nMeasuring brand reputation requires paying attention to what people are saying about you. And that means putting social listening and brand monitoring tools to work for you.\n\n1. Monitor brand and product mentions\n\nSet up Hootsuite Streams to track official tags of your brand or use of your hashtag, but don\u2019t forget to create streams to watch for misspellings and slang, too.

Use an analytics tool like Hootsuite Insights by Brandwatch to crunch public sentiment into cold, hard numbers.\n\nSocial sentiment can be a powerful data point to help social media goals and set KPIs. Sure, tracking the number of followers or engagement growth is important, too, but knowing if your followers and commenters actually like you makes those stats even more meaningful.\n\nWith Hootsuite Insights you can also set up alerts for brand-sentiment changes so you can react quickly and mitigate risk.\n\n3. See how you stack up\n\nYour reputation doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Even if you aren\u2019t that popular because you\u2019re in a tough industry, it can be helpful to know just how much more likable you are than your competitor. So make sure you\u2019re not just analyzing your own brand reputation; analyze your competitors\u2019 reputations too.\n\nPeople may not love one ride-sharing company, but if that ride-sharing company is still a more popular company than another ride-sharing company, they\u2019ve got something to celebrate.

People appreciate great customer service, good quality products, and positive working conditions. So if there\u2019s a public perception that you have all of these things, your business is in the best possible position to thrive.\n\nGrocery chain Wegmans, for example, has a reputation for being trust-worthy and ethical\u2026 and brought in revenue of more than $10 billion in 2022.\n\nConversely, if the public and media believe you offer poor customer service, are making unethical decisions behind the scenes, or offer terrible value, you\u2019re probably not going to be having a banner year (or attract your next super-star employee).\n\nWhether or not it\u2019s true, the perception of your brand and the public sentiment of your brand impact consumers\u2019 decision-making process. Ensuring that you have a positive brand reputation should be a vital component of your social media marketing strategy.\n\nPro tip: A social media management dashboard like Hootsuite can help you schedule reputation-boosting content, interact with commenters, practice social listening, and address negative issues before they spiral out of control.\n\nWatch the video below for bonus social listening tips from our own social marketing team here at Hootsuite.\n\nHow do you determine brand reputation?\n\nDetermining brand reputation requires paying attention to what people are saying about you.

Try to do the right thing \u2014 be considerate to your employees, your fans, your followers, your investors, and everyone else you come across. (That good ol\u2019 \u2018do unto others\u2019 rule will never fail you.)\n\nBut maintaining a positive reputation for your brand may also require some defensive maneuvers, too.\n\nSocial listening is the act of monitoring social media for mentions of your brand, your products, and your industry.

In a 2022 poll by Axios and Harris, TJ\u2019s was ranked the #1 most reputable brand in America.\n\nWhy do U.S. shoppers love the grocery chain so much? It\u2019s not just about those tiny peanut butter cups (though they probably don\u2019t hurt). People see it as a highly trustworthy, highly ethical company with a clear and admirable vision and a great company culture.\n\nSource: Axios\n\nThe stores themselves are laid-back and welcoming.

Dig into our Instagram hacks to make sure you know how to use each aspect of the app, from creating an enticing bio to copywriting engaging captions. All of these hacks can help you grow your Instagram following and build a loyal audience.\n\nWe\u2019ve broken these Instagram hacks down into categories so you can easily find the sections you need the most help with.\n\nTable of contents:\n\nGeneral Instagram hacks\n\n1. Get post notifications from your favorite accounts\n\nIs there an Instagram account you love? Or a feed you want to keep an eye on for inspiration? Turn on Post Notifications for specific accounts so you receive push notifications when they post new content.\n\nHead over to the Instagram Profile you want to stay up to date with. You should see a bell icon in the top right corner of their profile, right next to the three dots. Tap it, then choose if you want to receive notifications for new posts, Stories, reels, videos or live videos.\n\n2. Save your favorite posts\n\nInstagram allows you to create Collections and save photos that you love. Whether you\u2019re scrolling through your feed, the Explore page or a specific account, if you find a photo you want to keep for later, simply tap the bookmark icon on the right side directly underneath the photo.\n\nYou can even organize your saved posts into various Collections by going to your profile, tapping the hamburger menu, then tapping Saved. Organize similar images based on your interests for simpler reviewing at a later time\n\n3. Monitor how much time you\u2019ve spent on Instagram\n\nKeep an eye on your social media scrolling and screen time in the Instagram app. From your profile, tap the hamburger menu and select Your activity. Then scroll down and tap Time spent to find out how much time you\u2019ve spent on Instagram each day.\n\n4. Limit your scrolling time\n\nIn the exact same area, you can tap Set daily time limit and set a time limit for how long you want to allow yourself to spend on Instagram each day. The app will then send you a notification when your allotted time is up.\n\n5. See your Liked posts\n\nWant to take a trip back down memory lane? Head over to your profile and tap the hamburger menu. Then tap Your activity. From here, you can view all interactions you\u2019ve had on the app\u2014your likes, comments, tags and more.\n\n6. Manage multiple accounts from one device\n\nInstagram allows you to log in and manage up to five accounts from a single device, which is incredibly helpful for social media managers.\n\nSimply go to your profile, tap the hamburger menu then tap Settings and privacy. From here, you\u2019ll scroll down to the bottom to click Add account. You\u2019ll be taken to the login page to add another account to your device.\n\nThen you can navigate between the various profiles in one of two ways. First, you can go to your profile and tap the dropdown menu by your username. Second, you can switch to another profile by holding down on the profile tab in the bottom right corner until each account option appears.\n\nPerfect your Instagram grid with tools from Sprout Social Keep the look of your brand\u2019s Instagram consistent by managing your media in Sprout\u2019s asset library.

Add line breaks to your bio\n\nUse separate lines to explain what your brand does in your Instagram bio. However, you can\u2019t access this from the regular ABC keyboard.\n\nInstead, tap the 123 button in the bottom right corner to access the keyboard with numbers and special characters. Here, you\u2019ll get access to the Return button where you can add line breaks to make your bio more digestible.\n\n8. Tag other profiles in your bio\n\nIf you tag profiles in your bio, they\u2019re automatically clickable. This gives you the perfect opportunity to promote your other accounts on the app.\n\nUse this as an opportunity to tag your company handle in your personal bio or tag sister companies directly in your brand bio.\n\n9. Include hashtags\n\nJust as you can link to other profiles in your bio, you can also include hashtags. This is a great way to promote any branded hashtags your company may use for user-generated content.\n\n10. Change your bio\u2019s alignment\n\nStand out from the crowd and the rest of the left-aligned accounts out there and center or right-align your content.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to do. Simply copy the spaces between the arrows, but not the arrows themselves: >>\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800<<\n\nThen paste those spaces before each line of your bio. Add or remove spaces as necessary to perfectly center or right-align your bio.\n\n11. Include keywords in your profile name\n\nPlace a couple of strategic industry keywords in your profile name (not necessarily your username) to help your account show up for even more results when people search for people in your industry.\n\nBecause Instagram users sometimes search by keyword rather than username, adding a keyword into your profile name increases your chances of being found.\n\nFor example, this photographer opted to use \u201cCharleston Wedding Photographer\u201d as their profile name.\n\n12. Use special fonts\n\nYou can actually incorporate fun and different fonts into your Instagram bio by using a website like LingoJam. Type up your Instagram bio and copy and paste your favorite font into your profile. Get creative, especially if your brand voice aligns with these font styles.\n\nBut, before filling your Instagram bio or captions with these special fonts or unicode characters, keep in mind that they are not accessibility-friendly for people who are using screen readers. Use sparingly or for decorations, but don\u2019t rely solely on these fun fonts, as you don\u2019t want to exclude fans and followers from accessing your content.\n\n13. Add special characters\n\nTake another step to create a unique and engaging Instagram bio by using special characters. While you could always just choose a few emojis from your smartphone\u2019s keyboard, why stop there?\n\nInstead, you can use a free app like Character Pad on your smartphone or copy the symbols from Microsoft Word on desktop, then paste them right inside of your bio.\n\nAgain, keep your screen reader-using followers and fans in mind, as we\u2019ve pointed out in hack #12.\n\nInstagram hacks for sharing content\n\n14. Customize how strong your filter is\n\nIf you love a filter, but don\u2019t want the full effect on your photo, it\u2019s easy to adjust its strength. Select the filter, then tap the magic pen icon at the top of the screen.\n\nThen, adjust the filter strength on your photo by using the slider below the image. You\u2019ll preview the look and feel of your photo at the same time.\n\n15. Get creative with your grid\n\nThere are so many ways to get creative with your Instagram grid.\n\nColorblock your grid by incorporating a main color into nine photos at a time before switching it up. You can create a pattern where every third photo is a quote or graphic. You can have each photo flow into the next to create a puzzle grid.\n\nCheck out our post with 18 top Instagram accounts to check out for inspiration.\n\n16. Save drafts for later\n\nHave you started editing a post, but aren\u2019t ready to publish it yet? You can save it as a draft to come back to later!\n\nTap the plus sign and choose the image you want to work with. Add filters or start writing your caption, then tap the back button a couple of times.\n\nThe app will alert you and ask if you want to discard your post or save it as a draft. Choose Save draft to leave the app without losing your edits.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to post it, tap the plus sign again, then tap Drafts to finish publishing. You can also go back and delete your drafts by tapping Manage then Edit to remove the draft(s) you select.\n\n17. Save your live video\n\nDo you have an Instagram Live video you want to save and repurpose for later? It\u2019s incredibly easy to do. As soon as your live broadcast ends, simply tap Download Video and it will save directly to your camera roll for you to edit later. Keep in mind that it can take a few minutes to appear in your camera roll\u2014especially for longer videos.\n\n18. Remove the audio from videos\n\nNot every video needs audio, and not every video comes out with perfect or appropriate audio either. If you want to remove some background noise or your video doesn\u2019t necessarily need any audio, Instagram allows you to remove the audio in the app.\n\nWhen uploading a video to share in your feed, tap the music icon at the top of the editing page to access sound options. To remove the sound, tap Controls, then adjust the Camera audio down to 0.\n\nYou can add music, audio clips, voiceover or other sound effects in your audio\u2019s place if you choose to do so. Just search for the type of audio you\u2019d like to add instead.\n\n19. Create a cover photo for your video\n\nWant to choose the clip from your video that appears in your profile? You can find a good place in your video or create a cover photo by using a graphic design tool like Canva or Visme.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to share the video in Instagram, tap the Edit cover button on your video thumbnail. This allows you to choose a clip from the video that you want to appear as a cover photo or upload one from your camera roll.\n\n20. Turn your Instagram feed into an online shop\n\nIf you have an ecommerce business, Instagram shopping is a tool you definitely want to take advantage of. Share photos of products and tag them within each post, and you can effectively turn your Instagram feed into an online shop.\n\nThis is exactly what Dress Up has done in their feed. As you can see, each post with a shopping bag icon in the corner has products tagged, making it possible to purchase products directly from the post.\n\nSince 70% of Instagram users look to the platform for their next purchase, the shopping feature can help drive traffic to your site as well.\n\n21. Schedule your Instagram content ahead of time\n\nMake your Instagram management strategy as easy as possible by using a social media management platform such as Sprout Social to schedule your Instagram content ahead of time.\n\nInstagram hacks for writing captions\n\n22. Add line breaks to your captions\n\nJust like adding line breaks to your bios, it can be a great idea to add line breaks to longer captions and break up a giant wall of text.\n\nAgain, simply head over to the 123 keyboard rather than the default ABC keyboard to access the Return button.\n\nAlternatively, if you use a tool like Sprout Social to write your captions, you can add the line breaks into that tool\u2019s caption box directly by hitting the Enter/Return button on your keyboard.\n\n23. Hide your hashtags\n\nDon\u2019t want your hashtags to appear at the top of your captions? There are little tricks you can do to hide them further down in your captions so that you can still promote your posts to a wider audience without spamming your followers.\n\nTake a page out of WallyGrow\u2019s book and include several periods between your caption and your hashtags to put some space between them and push them down away from your photo.\n\nYou can also place your hashtags in a comment underneath your photo to keep them out of your caption entirely.\n\nWith Sprout, you can post your image and first comment at the same time, so you have the opportunity to capture engagement from hashtags immediately and keep your caption free of hashtags.\n\n24. Use special fonts in your captions\n\nAnother great application of a previously mentioned Instagram hack is to use special fonts or characters to jazz up your actions. Incorporating special fonts into your captions can make them even more engaging than the regular Instagram font.\n\nAgain, use special fonts and characters sparingly in your captions so your content is accessible to your followers who use screen readers, as we pointed out in hack #12. However, this hack used in the first sentence of your caption or to call out certain words can help grab attention or create emphasis.\n\n25. Filter comments based on keywords\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with a social media troll, or you want to keep your social media feed clean of certain words for your audience, you\u2019re able to filter or block comments based on specific keywords.\n\nGo to your profile and tap the hamburger menu before going to Settings and privacy.\n\nFrom there, scroll down and tap Hidden Words. In this area, you can choose to hide comments and messages that contain offensive words, but you can also create and manage custom words, phrases and even emoji that you want filtered out.\n\n26. Turn off commenting on certain posts\n\nNot every post needs a comment. If you want to turn off comments on certain posts, Instagram allows you to do just that.\n\nWhen you\u2019re creating a new post and get to the page where you add your caption, tap Advanced Settings at the bottom of the screen, then toggle the Turn Off Commenting option.\n\nYou can also turn comments on and off retroactively by going to an existing post, tapping the three dots and toggling the commenting feature on or off.\n\n27. Reply faster to comments\n\nDo you get a lot of the same questions on your posts? \u201cWhen does this sale end?\u201d or \u201cWhen will this item be restocked?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to set up quick-reply methods on your smartphone so that you can respond to each one as efficiently as possible.\n\niOS smartphone users can do this in their iPhone settings in General > Keyboard > Text Replacement.\n\nThere are already several options in place for autocorrects, but you can tap the plus sign in the top right corner to set up a few shortcuts for quick-responding to comments.\n\nFor example, you can create a shortcut where you type \u201cHalloSale,\u201d and have autocorrect replace it with your brand\u2019s actual Halloween sale information.\n\nInstagram stories hacks\n\n28. Change highlight covers without publishing them to your story\n\nPreviously, you had to publish new Instagram story highlight covers to your story in order to actually change your highlight covers.\n\nBut now, you can change your highlight covers straight from your camera roll.\n\nSimply tap and hold the highlight you want to update, then tap Edit highlight on the popup that appears. Tap Edit cover then select the photo you want as your new highlight cover from your camera roll.\n\n29. Create shapes with text\n\nInstagram Stories has several different fonts, meaning you have several different ways to customize your story content. So play around with different symbols and fonts to create eye-catching captions to your Stories.\n\nFor example, the Instagram Story above likely uses enlarged m-dashes (\u2014) as decoration and a backdrop to a snippet of text. The overall look and feel of these decorations will change depending on which font you use.\n\nThe asterisk can be used as stars or snowflakes, and periods can be blown up to create large dots. Just be conscious of overdoing it with extra characters\u2013similar to what we mentioned about special bio fonts in hack #12, screen readers may interpret these as individual text characters and create confusion for those relying on them to interpret your content.\n\n30. Create ombr\u00e9 or rainbow text\n\nDecorate your Instagram stories by creating ombr\u00e9 or rainbow text. This is a fun effect, but you need to practice it a few times because it can be hard to master.\n\nOnce you write your text using the font of your choice, select all of it, or the words you want to ombr\u00e9/rainbow. Then you need to use one finger to hold the words you\u2019ve selected and the other finger to hold down on the color you want to start with.\n\nPro tip: This order is important. You must hold your text before touching the colors or else this won\u2019t work.\n\nDrag both fingers across the screen simultaneously, moving across the text and across the colors at the same time. You\u2019ll go from top to bottom or bottom to top to ombr\u00e9 the text with a single color and front one side to the other to create a rainbow effect.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to do this process slowly in order to master it and get your colors just right. Don\u2019t rush! The end effect is well worth it.\n\n31. Create a solid background\n\nDon\u2019t want an image as your story background? You might opt for a solid background in order to share some sort of announcement or news with the stickers or text options.\n\nTo do this, take or upload a random photo to get your story started. Then, open up the Draw menu. Find the color you want to use as your background, then tap and hold on your screen. Your full background will change to that color.\n\n32. Hide a story from specific users\n\nWhen you create a new story, open it up. Then tap the three dots in the bottom right corner labeled More. Tap Story settings, then Hide story from. This will allow you to select specific accounts to hide all of your stories from. You can reset this to remove accounts from this list once the story you\u2019ve hidden from them has expired.\n\n33. Add images from your camera roll\n\nYou can add an image from your camera roll to your story by swiping up on the story screen and choosing a photo from your camera roll. This will add the photo to the full screen of your story.\n\nIf you want to add an additional photo\u2014or add a photo from your camera roll onto a photo or video you just took\u2014tap on the Stickers icon from the editing options. Tap on the circle with the camera icon to access your camera roll.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve added the photo to your story, you can resize it, move it around and even tap on it to change the shape of the image. Get rectangle, heart, star, circle and square options.\n\n34. Add multiple photos in a story\n\nThere are a couple of different ways you can add multiple photos in a single story.\n\nThe first way involves adding photos from your camera roll\u2014which we just learned how to do in the last hack. Start by taking a photo in the app that you\u2019d want to use as a background. Or you can head back to hack #31 and create a solid background.\n\nThen, follow the steps from hack #33\u2014head to the Stickers menu and tap the option to pull something in from your camera roll. Repeat this step to pull as many images as you want into your story.\n\nThe other option is to use a grid layout. Open up the story camera. On the left side of the screen, you\u2019ll see options like \u201cCreate,\u201d \u201cBoomerang, \u201cLayout\u201d and more. Tap Layout\u2014or the icon with three windows in a square.\n\nThis will enable you to create a grid with multiple photos in a single story. You can choose between six different grids with the ability to add two, three, four or six photos to a single story.\n\n35. Turn live photos into Boomerangs\n\nIf you have live photos turned on in your iPhone settings, you can easily turn these photos into a Boomerang in your story. Swipe up in the stories camera to access your camera roll. Existing live photos will have the Boomerang icon (an infinity symbol) in the top left corner.\n\nTap one of these photos to open it in your story. It will default to a still photo, but you can tap the Boomerang icon again in the top navigation to convert the life photo into a looping Boomerang video.\n\n36. Add brand colors to your story\n\nWant to get the text or drawing you add to your story to match your brand colors exactly? Start by saving an image with your brand palette to your camera roll.\n\nNext, take a photo/record a video or upload one from your camera roll. Then, go into the Stickers menu, tap on the camera roll option and bring the image with your brand colors into the story.\n\nType out your text or open the drawing menu. Select your text then tap the dropper to select a color from your photo. You\u2019ll want to use the dropper tool before you start drawing. Choose a color from your color palette to use in your text or drawing.\n\nInstagram growth hacks\n\n37. Cross promote your content\n\nCross-promoting your content is a great way to grow. You can easily connect your Instagram account to a Facebook Page to cross-promote posts, reels and stories.\n\nTo share a post, make sure you\u2019ve connected your Facebook and Instagram business accounts. Then, you\u2019ll have the ability to toggle the option to share to your Facebook Page on or off each time you post a new Instagram image or video.\n\nYou can also opt in to share your stories to both platforms as well.\n\nIf your business uses Twitter, you can even cross-promote your tweets onto your Instagram stories easily. Select a tweet, tap the sharing button and select Instagram stories. It will appear seamlessly as a sticker in your story for you to easily share with your audience.\n\n38. Use paid advertising\n\nTake advantage of Instagram advertising to help reach an even wider audience. Choose from a number of ad types, like:\n\nPhoto ads\n\nCarousel ads\n\nVideo ads\n\nReels ads\n\nStory ads\n\nCreate your ad visuals, write your captions and select your target audience before promoting your ads on Instagram.\n\n39. Create an influencer marketing strategy\n\nInfluencer marketing is a great strategy for Instagram as the platform is so visual and there are endless influencers in every niche to work with. Create a strategy that focuses on the outreach and partnership with influencers in your industry.\n\nYou can send them free products to try then put together a budget for each influencer to create photos or videos to promote your products. This is a great way to reach an even wider audience of your target customer.\n\n40. Publish at the best time\n\nDon\u2019t publish your content willy nilly\u2014look at your data to discover the best times to post. Based on Sprout Social\u2019s analysis, the overall best days to post include:\n\nMondays from 10 a.m. to noon\n\nTuesdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\nWednesdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\nFridays from 9 to 11 a.m.\n\nHowever, you can use your Sprout Social account to help find the optimal times for your specific business and followers. When scheduling your Instagram content, choose the Choose optimal times option to select from times that Sprout\u2019s AI has deemed best for your business.\n\nInstagram reels hacks\n\n41. Schedule your reels\n\nScheduling content makes the job of a social media manager so much easier. We\u2019ve already covered how to schedule your typical Instagram posts\u2014but make sure you\u2019re scheduling your reels in advance, too.\n\nConsider batching. Create reels in batches, then schedule them in batches. This can help make your content creation process much more efficient.\n\n42. Share your reels in-feed\n\nWhen you create a new Instagram reel, you have the option to also share it to the feed. This means it will appear in the main Instagram feed as well as on your main feed, rather than just in the reels tab. Toggling this option on gives you a better chance of reaching a larger audience.\n\n43. Try out transitions\n\nOne way to make your Instagram reels even more engaging is to test out different transitions. A transition is how you splice two clips together. Creative transitions can make your videos even more fun to watch.\n\nCheck out various transition videos on TikTok and Instagram reels to find inspiration for transitions you can test out in your own video content.\n\n44. Use music that\u2019s trending\n\nUsing trending audio clips is a great way to increase viewers on your videos. Start by recording your reel in the app or uploading an existing video. Then, tap the music icon to access the dashboard we showed you back in hack #18.\n\nFrom here, you can view featured audio, search for clips you want to use or browse suggested music for your videos.\n\nInstagram direct messaging hacks\n\n45. Experiment with disappearing notes\n\nInstagram launched a new \u201cdisappearing note\u201d feature in the Direct Messaging tab. With this feature, users can create a 60-character note that appears at the top of the DM tab. It can be used as a \u201cstatus\u201d of sorts, and this note disappears after 24 hours.\n\nTake advantage of this feature and use it creatively. For example, consider sharing a limited time promo code to see if anyone uses it to make a purchase, share new product launch information and more.\n\nYou can also share a song as your disappearing note if you so choose.\n\n46. Create a chat group\n\nWorking with multiple brands or collaborating with a few influencers on the same project? Consider creating a chat group in DMs. To do this, tap the new message icon in the top right corner. You\u2019ll then type in the names of each person you\u2019re wanting to add to the group. Then tap Create group chat to start messaging with everyone at once.\n\n47. Make sure your notifications are set up\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to answer messages in real time if you don\u2019t have notifications set up. First, enable push notifications in your phone settings. Then, go to the hamburger menu on your profile before tapping Settings and privacy. Tap the Notifications menu.\n\nHere, you can choose what types of notifications you want to receive\u2014posts, messages, etc. Tap Messages to ensure that all of these options are turned on. This way, you\u2019ll be immediately notified each time your brand gets a message from a customer.\n\nRamp up your Instagram marketing\n\nUse these Instagram hacks to improve your Instagram marketing and start trying out some new tips and tricks.

While that sounds great to executives and stakeholders, they may not understand how the costs associated with social media translate to business objectives.\n\nIf you need help getting buy-in for your social strategy and building your budget, this social media management costs guide will help you get started.\n\nWe\u2019ll walk you through what is normally included in the cost of social media management, how the cost of agencies compares to freelancers and the average amount a business should spend. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nSocial media management costs overall\n\nFirst, we need to be clear. There is no one-size-fits-all social media management cost. Brands will spend differently depending on their unique goals.\n\nBased on average costs, we determined a comprehensive social media management program is roughly $12,300 per month. That number includes all costs related to content creation, advertising campaigns and social media management software.\n\nContent creation : $7,950 per month\n\nSocial advertising: $5,000 per month\n\nPlatform management: $5,000 per month\n\nTotal: $17,950 per month\n\nHowever, as a rule of thumb, a more basic program costs anywhere between $500\u2013$5,000 per month.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how we calculated this figure.\n\nCost of launching on a new social channel and creating content\n\nAlthough launching on a social channel is technically free, running the profile and creating a content calendar costs a brand anywhere from $500 to $10,000 per month.\n\nThe estimated social media management costs depend on factors like talent sourcing (in-house talent vs. outsource) and third-party tools. For example, at Sprout, our content and social management is driven by our internal team members but we contract content creation too.\n\nHere are the average rates for both:\n\nSocial Media Specialist salary: $ 3,800 per month\n\nSocial Media Manager freelance rate: $20\u2013150 per hour, based on experience\n\nbased on experience Creator compensation: $150\u2013$500 per post or video\n\nCost of social media ad campaigns\n\nTo run a successful platform-specific advertising campaign, you should plan to invest at least $5,000 per month, according to Sprout\u2019s Manager of Digital Marketing, Maggie Anderson. She points out that often the cost can be much higher, so you should consider this number a starting point.\n\nAnderson explains, \u201cBefore finalizing your social ad campaign budget, pinpoint your goal, campaign duration and audience. These factors will help you choose target strategies and platforms that will work best for your campaign\u2014which ultimately determines your budget.\u201d\n\nAs you incorporate more platforms and run longer campaigns, expect the overall expense to increase.\n\nYour campaign metrics will reveal ways you may need to optimize your strategy to reach your desired goals, so leave room in your ad budget for flexibility.\n\nPlatform management costs\n\nWhether you manage multiple platforms through a social media management tool, an agency partner or both, you will pay around $500\u2013$5,000 per month.\n\nThe price is influenced by the number of profiles you manage, the volume of inbound messages and mentions you receive, the size of your community and the features you use.\n\nContinue reading to learn more about the costs of working with a social media management agency and using a social media management tool.\n\nSocial media management agency pricing\n\nSome brands use agencies to complement their in-house social teams, while others use them to outsource all their social media management tactics. If you decide to work with an agency, here are the parameters for social media management costs you should plan for.\n\nWe asked 228 agencies how much they\u2019re charging for their social media services. About 33% of the respondents said they charge an average of $1,501\u2013$3,000 per month, while 27% of agencies are charging $501\u2013$1,500 and 12% more than $5,000.\n\nWhile the services offered depend on the agency type, they often entail:\n\nPlatform management\n\nSocial strategy\n\nContent development\n\nSocial analytics\n\nRunning paid social campaigns\n\nEngagement and community management\n\nKeep in mind the scope of your social media management needs will impact cost. Prices vary depending on your goals, service term and the number of tasks the agency performs.\n\nSocial media management freelancer pricing\n\nIf you opt to work with freelancers, you will need to budget that into your social media management pricing. Freelancer costs shift based on their experience level and the extent of your project. On average, freelancers charge between $500\u2013$10,000 per month. Many freelancers also offer hourly rates.\n\nOnce you determine your goals and budget, search for freelancers with the skills you need who fit your price range. Here\u2019s a list of marketplaces you can use to kickstart your search:\n\nUpwork: A freelancing platform and independent talent workforce that helps you scale faster and transform your business. Upwork is a great option for larger projects that require subject matter expertise. Fiverr: A global online marketplace for freelancer services.

Make sure their work aligns with your goals and expectations before partnering on large-scale, critical projects.\n\nSocial media management software pricing\n\nToday\u2019s social media managers know publishing, scheduling and reporting from the native platforms would be inefficient (and, in some cases, impossible). Social media management software simplifies the hard work of social media so you can focus on connecting with your audience and building insights-driven strategies that elevate your brand.\n\nFor a robust social media management platform, you can expect to pay up to $1,000+ per month to cover end-to-end needs.

From building brand reputation to understanding customers and improving competitive positioning, social data is the missing piece you need to solve your leadership team\u2019s most pressing challenges.\n\nBut raw data points without context don\u2019t tell the full story. To prove how social fulfills business objectives, it\u2019s essential to dig deeper.\n\nIn this guide, we break down the benefits of social media data collection, how to mine for meaningful data and tools you can use to automate your data collection workflows. No matter your internal audience or business focus, a data-driven approach to social media delivers transformative insights.\n\nWhat is social media data?\n\nSocial media data is information collected from social media networks that demonstrates how users share, view or engage with your content or profiles, and the content or profiles of your competitors. Raw social data includes:\n\nShares\n\nLikes\n\nMentions\n\nImpressions\n\nHashtag usage\n\nURL clicks\n\nKeyword analysis\n\nFollower count\n\nComments\n\nMessage volume\n\nMessage response rate and time\n\nSocial media data also includes the insights you glean from social listening when analyzing conversations and trends related to your brand. These include conversations relevant to your company, competitors and industry at large, and often hold the answers to questions the C-suite asks (example: how are people talking about our brand online?).\n\nHow does analyzing social media data work?\n\nCollecting raw social media data and measuring it against your goals and objectives is the process of social media data analysis. This is a vital step that reveals what is and isn\u2019t working\u2014both for you and your competitors.\n\nWhile raw social media data can be powerful, what\u2019s most influential is the value you provide when you make sense of the data and analyze the metrics in compelling ways. For example, many CFOs aren\u2019t well-versed in the business impact of increased impressions or engagements. But when you share social data in the context of org-wide impacts and combine it with other data sources, you help future-proof your company and propel your business forward.\n\nThrough Sprout Social\u2019s integration with Salesforce and Tableau, you can present social data alongside metrics from other digital channels. This customizable dashboard gives you visualizations of social, ad and email performance data without requiring time-consuming work.\n\nWhat are the benefits of social media data collection?\n\nSocial media data collection has far-reaching benefits that extend to every area of your organization. According to The 2023 State of Social Media report, most business leaders agree that social media data and insights play a pivotal role across companies\u2014including PR, trendspotting, competitor analysis, proactive crisis management and communication functions.\n\nWhen social data is presented in an influential way, here are some specific ways it can improve your brand\u2019s performance, prove the ROI of social to stakeholders and provide value to other teams.\n\nTrack metrics and KPIs\n\nBy regularly collecting social metrics, you can assess your performance to test if your strategy successfully meets your KPIs. This empowers you to make adjustments to your content and workflows on a regular basis\u2014whether it\u2019s quarterly, monthly or even weekly\u2014and share reports with stakeholders to keep them informed of your progress.\n\nBenchmark performance\n\nCollecting social media data enables you to benchmark your content and customer care performance. With these metrics, you can compare your performance to your past data, industry averages and competitors to make sure your brand stays on track.\n\nUnderstand your audience better\n\nInsights from social provide a direct line to your target audience that will help you rise above your competition and ensure the long-term health of your business. Not only will you learn what is going well regarding your social performance, you will also better understand what your customers need from your brand and products. Essential intel you can pass along to your brand and R&D teams.\n\nFind your best time to post\n\n\u200b\u200bThough there are general best times to post on social media, you should consult social data to find your unique best practices. Through analysis, you can discover when your target audience is active and most likely to engage, and adjust your posting schedule accordingly.\n\nBecause this can be a heavy lift, try automating it to unburden your bandwidth.

Here are actionable ways to collect meaningful social media data that actually delivers the metrics you need.\n\n1. Ask specific questions\n\nYour social media data collection is only as good as the questions you ask. Simple questions like \u201chow many followers do we have?\u201d might be relatively easy to answer, but they don\u2019t usually provide attention-grabbing insights or get to the root of what you can learn about your customers.\n\nTo ask the right questions, the social team needs a seat at the table.\n\nAs Jamie Gilpin, Sprout\u2019s CMO, explained at a recent LinkedIn Roundtable event, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know your organization\u2019s most important business priorities or objectives, how can you deliver results that matter to leaders?\u201d\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already briefed on your company\u2019s goals, now is the time to meet with leaders and develop a regular discourse. Or, if you don\u2019t have direct access to your leadership team, seek support from other stakeholders who can help you uncover the information you need. Find out what keeps your CMO up at night. Learn what challenges the revenue org is facing. Discover the insights R&D wishes they had.\n\nThrough this exploration, you will uncover the right questions to ask and jumpstart high-impact data mining.\n\n2. Find your core social media KPIs and metrics\n\nBased on the insights you learned in step #1, you need to define core KPIs that ladder-up to your organization\u2019s goals and keep a pulse on your social performance. These metrics will be the foundation of how you define success for your business on social. By evaluating these metrics consistently, you get the intel you need to offer thoughtful and deep understanding of your audience and the future of your business.\n\nFor example, some common KPIs for brands include audience reach, customer engagement, response times and social listening volume. You will notice these metrics aren\u2019t always easily accessible in native social platforms.\n\nBy using a platform like Sprout Social, you can fully leverage all the data available on social and swiftly prepare presentation-ready reports. Some of our platform\u2019s analytics highlights include:\n\nCross-Network Performance Reports: Aggregate data across networks from your profiles and posts.

The report pulls total volume, engagements, impressions, unique authors and sentiment of specific topics and keywords\u2014whether it\u2019s your branded hashtags or the name of your new product.\n\n3. Track conversations around your brand\n\nSocial is like a 24/7 focus group. Your audience is always sharing things they\u2019re excited about, their challenges and their favorite products. They even share unfiltered thoughts about you and your competitors. But trying to sift through the noise to find these valuable insights can be frustrating.\n\nSocial listening can help you zero-in on this earned data and give stakeholders the answers they\u2019re looking for. Set up a social listening query to start tracking what discussions are trending in your industry, what your audience cares about and to figure out the \u201cwhy\u201d behind you and your competitors\u2019 performances.\n\nSprout\u2019s listening solution uncovers critical insights in seconds, including:\n\nListening Topic Conversation Insights: The Conversation tab of the Listening topic mentioned above provides details about the top keywords, hashtags, mentions and emoticons popular with your audience.

Stats, trends and tips marketers should know for 2023", "content": "Online shopping has gone social. Imagine scrolling through Instagram, finding something you love. You complete your purchase all within the app and avoid navigating to a product landing page. That\u2019s the exact type of experience social commerce offers. It simplifies the purchase journey by eliminating extra steps and makes consumers more likely to complete their purchases.\n\nAs such, social commerce could be the key to success when using social media for retail. In this post, we take a deep dive into what social commerce is and how your brand can make the most of it.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is social commerce?\n\nSocial commerce is the buying and selling of goods or services directly within a social media platform. It involves taking social media beyond its traditional role in the discovery process. Instead, users will get to complete the entire purchase journey within the same platform. That means they can quickly go from discovery to purchase without leaving their preferred apps.\n\nLeading social media platforms now offer dedicated social commerce tools to retailers. This includes platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and TikTok. Using these tools, you can create digital storefronts right within the respective platforms. That way, people can use these storefronts to discover and buy products without having to visit another website.\n\nSocial commerce vs. ecommerce\n\nEcommerce broadly encompasses the process of buying and selling goods online. It includes selling through different digital channels including online marketplaces, websites and dedicated retailer apps.\n\nMeanwhile, social commerce involves selling directly through a social media platform. Since social media is an online channel, social commerce is a subset of ecommerce but it\u2019s not the same as ecommerce.\n\nBest social commerce platforms to use in 2023\n\nFacebook, Instagram and Pinterest were the first to introduce native social commerce capabilities. Now platforms like YouTube and TikTok have joined in and started rolling out their own social commerce features.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in getting ahead of this potential revenue channel, here are the platforms you\u2019ll want to test out:\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook\u2019s social commerce tool, Facebook Shops, has a very low barrier to entry. Shops are free to set up and are accessible within your Facebook business profile.\n\nIf you\u2019re using a partner platform, you can automatically sync your entire inventory list in seconds. If not, you can use a spreadsheet to upload product information.\n\nThe Facebook Shop tab on the platform\u2019s mobile app features products based on user preferences. This helps to encourage organic brand discovery. Once consumers find your products, they can complete a purchase within the app or on your website. Sellers communicate with customers within Messenger to ask questions, offer support and more.\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram Shopping is directly linked to your Facebook Shop. To set up a shop, users must link their Instagram business account to their Facebook business profile. Once that\u2019s completed, users can upload an existing product catalog or create a new one.\n\nThen you can use Instagram Product Tags to make your content shoppable and your products easier to discover. Product Tags allow you to highlight items from your product catalog directly in your videos and posts. Users can tap on a tag and immediately learn more about the product.\n\nThe \u201cView shop\u201d button lets them browse your other listings and enjoy a seamless shopping experience. Like Facebook, purchases take place within the app or on your business website.\n\nPinterest\n\nPinterest Shopping has made it easier for retailers to sell on Pinterest. It lets you upload your product catalog to your Pinterest business page. You can then tag products in your Pins so people can click on those tags to learn more about them.\n\nKeep in mind that these Product Pins are not direct social commerce tools. Buyers will still get redirected to a product-specific landing page to complete their purchase. However, it simplifies the buying journey as people can get the product info right within Pinterest.\n\nTikTok\n\nIt\u2019s easier than ever for retailers to make money on TikTok since the platform introduced social commerce capabilities. Businesses can now set up a TikTok Shop to showcase their products and drive purchases directly within the app. With this feature, you\u2019ll be able to create shoppable videos and even enable viewers to shop directly on your TikTok LIVE broadcasts.\n\n5 benefits of social commerce for your business\n\n1. Reach a wider audience of potential customers\n\nSocial media usage is constantly on the rise, with more than 4 billion people using it worldwide. Couple that with the fact that consumers are discovering new brands and products through social media.\n\nAccording to Sprout Social\u2019s Social Shopping in 2022 study, 40% of consumers were finding the perfect product through a brand\u2019s organic post. Researching products on social media and seeing a friend\u2019s post are other common ways consumer\u2019s discover products.\n\nWhen you leverage social commerce, your products get in front of a massive audience. You\u2019ll reach more people who could turn into customers.\n\n2. Convert customers where they are and remove friction\n\nSocial commerce makes it easy to convert customers where they are since they can directly make purchases on the platform. It eliminates the need to switch to a different app or website to find the product they want to buy. As such, it removes friction and barriers to purchase by shortening the buying journey.\n\n3. Increase reviews and recommendations through social proof\n\nIf your business is new to selling online, social media is the perfect place to begin establishing much-needed social proof. When shopping online, your buyers can\u2019t necessarily test or try on your product. Reviews can be the key to making an educated purchase decision.\n\nManaging your end-to-end customer journey on social media creates a positive feedback loop. This will eventually have an impact on your bottom line.\n\nYour social content attracts new followers into your funnel. And offering social commerce gives them a chance to purchase and leave reviews in one centralized location. As your engagement grows with new reviews coming in, it sends a positive signal to social media algorithms. These algorithms will deem your content relevant to even more potential customers.\n\n4. Gather useful data on your customers\u2019 social habits\n\nSocial commerce features give you direct access to your customers\u2019 social profiles. This gives you valuable customer data that you can use to inform your existing strategy.\n\nCombine these insights with social media listening to get an even better understanding of your audience. That way, you get an even more comprehensive look into the habits and interests of your customers.\n\nYou can create more inspired conversion experiments based on these insights. Findings can inform messaging A/B tests, CTA optimizations and more. So you can make a bigger impact with your target audience.\n\n5. Drive additional revenue than traditional ecommerce\n\nSocial commerce is driving an increasing portion of marketing-driven revenue for ecommerce businesses. According to McKinsey, retail social commerce sales in the US amounted to $45.7 billion in revenue in 2022. Experts predict that the number will hit close to $80 billion by 2025.\n\nAlthough this is just about 5% of the total retail ecommerce sales, it still translates to increased revenue. As social commerce opens up new avenues for your business to drive sales, it gives you the opportunity to grow your revenue.\n\n6 social commerce statistics marketers should know\n\nFacebook is the most popular platform for social commerce. An estimated 5 million users in the US made a purchase on the platform in 2022. Instagram comes next with an estimated 41 million buyers making a purchase. TikTok is another popular option with 23.7 million users buying on the platform. Pinterest draws in about 15.9 million social shoppers on the platform. Targeted ads are the number one way for social shoppers to find the perfect product. Forty-nine percent of people surveyed in the Sprout shopping study were discovering products through these ads. Recommendations from friends are the most compelling reasons consumers make a purchase on social.\n\n3 social commerce trends for 2023\n\nMany of the current ecommerce trends we see today influence the trends shaping social commerce today.\n\nLivestream shopping will drive a significant portion of social media purchases. Sixty-one percent of shoppers in the Sprout study already use this social commerce feature. Moreover, 53% were planning to use more of it. VR and AR experiences will enhance the social shopping experience. Platforms like Pinterest have even introduced a \u201cTry On\u201d feature powered by augmented reality. This allows shoppers to try on makeup products and see how home d\u00e9cor products look in their space.\n\nInclusive marketing will be a key purchase factor in social commerce. Sixty percent of shoppers in Sprout\u2019s social shopping study said that inclusive marketing would make them more likely to buy from a brand.\n\n4 successful social commerce examples\n\nCheck out these four social commerce examples to find inspiration on how to build your own strategy.\n\n1. The Tiny Tassel\n\nThe Tiny Tassel is a retailer specializing in handmade jewelry. It uses Facebook Shop features to create informative, Facebook-native product pages. Each listing features detailed product descriptions, customization options and shipping information.\n\nBrands should follow Tiny Tassel\u2019s lead and post listings that communicate value. This builds trust with potential buyers who are new to your brand, motivating them to make that first purchase.\n\n2. Patagonia\n\nPinterest boards can serve as product navigation tools for your audience. Take Patagonia\u2019s Pinterest structure: the Product Pin boards mimic its website navigation. This creates a familiar experience for returning audiences. Similarly, new potential customers will enjoy a consistent experience when they click through to the brand\u2019s main site.\n\nMost social commerce platforms offer just enough flexibility to recreate your brand experience. Use these tools to create consistency for your audience.\n\n3. Target\n\nCatalog setup can take a long time If your ecommerce platform doesn\u2019t partner with Facebook. Rather than list all of its products, Target focuses on items that align with its Instagram content strategy. This creates a better browsing experience for its established Instagram audience.\n\nIf you\u2019re working with a larger inventory, you can use Sprout\u2019s Instagram Performance Reports . This helps you make smarter listing choices based on content engagement and popular hashtags.\n\n4. Made by Mitchell\n\nMakeup brand, Made by Mitchell introduced a product that was exclusively available on TikTok Shop. The brand took advantage of TikTok\u2019s LIVE shopping feature for its initial launch.\n\nThe brand had collaborated with TikTok creator, Melissa Jade for this collection. So the two parties had a duel livestream on both their accounts. This attracted 50,000 LIVE views combined and a total of 2.4 million product views. The livestream session even had a 100% sell-out rate.\n\nBrands should follow suit and take full advantage of TikTok\u2019s LIVE shopping feature to engage shoppers in real-time. You can even maximize your reach with influential content creators.\n\nThe brand further encouraged sales through mystery beauty bundles. People were buying these mystery bundles on the brand\u2019s TikTok Shop and creating unboxing videos. This helped to build a buzz around the collection and persuaded others to buy their own mystery boxes.\n\n5 ways to increase sales on social media using Sprout Social\n\n1. Know your audience\n\nAlign your social commerce strategy with your target social audience for maximum engagement. Choose products and messaging based on this specific customer subset instead of simply repeating what\u2019s on your website.\n\nA social media analytics tool can help you keep up with information as your audience grows. Sprout Profile Reports offer follower demographic data to create platform-wise customer personas. Use these in combination with post performance data to make your initial decisions about which products to list and how to position them.\n\n2. Schedule your content\n\nOnce you share a listing, schedule some promotional posts to build interest and drive traffic to your new social storefront. This is a great way to share additional product information, like walkthroughs and close-up shots.\n\nUse Sprout\u2019s built-in social commerce catalogs to add shoppable tags and links to your products while scheduling your content. By adding products to your posts, you can meet customers where they want to shop and streamline their purchase process.\n\n3. Personalize your replies\n\nAsking questions about a product or service is one of the top reasons consumers reach out to brands on social. They may have requests for specific product details, ask about a specific order or want to know which options are available. Not only can you answer those questions by recommending a product, but you can even share a direct link to buy it. It\u2019s a win-win\u2014you\u2019re delivering helpful service and making it easier for consumers to buy what they\u2019re looking for.\n\nSprout helps you add direct product links to replies using built-in product catalogs from Facebook Shops and Shopify.

Learn what works (and do more of it)\n\nAs you dip your toe into the world of social commerce, the best thing you can do is measure, measure, measure. Knowing what\u2019s working can help you repeat your success as you scale your strategy. It can even help to illuminate new opportunities you might have otherwise missed.\n\nMonitor your social analytics to manage performance. Remember to categorize your posts in Sprout by tagging them, giving you an in-depth look at what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Combine this with UTM parameters and you can dig in, see which posts drove sales and adjust your strategy to optimize your posts. With Sprout, you can schedule report deliveries on a weekly or monthly basis to stay on top of this process.\n\n5. Automate conversations and increase response times\n\nFailing to provide timely responses is one of the biggest social commerce mistakes. Before people finalize their purchases on your social media storefront, they may need some additional info. It\u2019s your job to ensure that those potential customers get the response they need when they need it.\n\nSprout lets you build chatbots with customized responses so you can automate those conversations. That way, you can provide quick responses even when your support team is unavailable.

People can click on those tags to find out more about the product and make a purchase.", "date": "2023-06-30"}, {"link": "https://sproutsocial.com/insights/lo-fi-content/", "title": "How to take smart risks with lo-fi social content", "content": "In late 2009, Domino\u2019s released a brutally honest commercial, publicizing customers\u2019 overwhelmingly negative feelings about their pizza\u2014and asking folks to give them a second chance. It was a massive risk, but one that paid off. The quarter following the campaign\u2019s release, same-store sales were up 14%.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, risk-taking has always been a hallmark of strong brand marketing. In the world of social today\u2014where generating organic reach feels like a moving target and production budgets are limited\u2014pursuing smart risks can be the deciding factor in your content\u2019s success.\n\nEnter: lo-fi content. Publishing visuals and video that hasn\u2019t been scrutinized in creative briefs and edited ad nauseum carries a degree of risk. But as we explain in this article, it\u2019s what audiences crave.\n\nKeep reading to learn how to build the business case for creating more lo-fi content, and ways to integrate it into your social strategy.\n\nWhat is lo-fi social media content?\n\nLo-fi social media content is personality-driven social media content that has low production value. Social media consultant and Link in Bio newsletter creator Rachel Karten summed it up in a Sprout masterclass webinar, \u201cYou have to do something weird or wacky or fun or personality driven. People now expect brands to show up in that way across all platforms.\u201d\n\nLo-fi content looks and feels more authentic and less glossy than traditional branded social content because it usually is. It\u2019s often shot on an iPhone and involves little if any editing at all, making it more budget-friendly (with a better ROI than highly polished content).\n\nLo-fi social media content is still selling to your audience, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it. Examples of lo-fi content include, but are not limited to:\n\nFacebook photo dumps\n\nScreengrabs of TikToks\n\nInstagram Stories that are clearly shot on someone\u2019s phone\n\nThe risks and rewards of lo-fi content\n\nFor emerging and established brands alike, lo-fi content can be a step outside of the marketing comfort zone. Unpolished posts run the risk of showing your product or service in a non-aspirational light (even if it\u2019s highlighting a very real customer use case), or showcasing a sense of humor that your audience might not get.\n\nDone well, however, the upside of smart lo-fi content is undeniable, from higher ROI to scaling your brand awareness efforts. By striking the right balance of casual and relevant, these posts can humanize your brand and encourage shareability.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the shift toward lo-fi content?\n\nThe pendulum swing from pristine, big budget advertising campaigns to lo-fi social content has been building up for years. There are a few factors that have contributed to this shift:\n\n1. The pandemic\n\nDuring our webinar, Karten noted how the challenges brands faced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards more lo-fi content. Specifically, more conservative budgets and the inability for marketers to travel and film on-site.\n\nAs major brands began to incorporate more low-budget content into their feeds out of necessity, they noticed something\u2014audiences ate it up. It was an early sign that aspirational content wasn\u2019t the only option anymore.\n\n2. The algorithms\n\nWhile the pandemic initiated the shift toward lo-fi social content, it was hardly the only driver. Algorithms, particularly on Instagram and TikTok, increasingly emphasize the power of discovery.\n\nThe more a particular post gets shared, the more likely it is to land on the Instagram Explore or TikTok For You pages. Today, it\u2019s off the cuff, lo-fi content that users are more likely to share with their followers.\n\nIn other words, the combination of consumers wanting more authentic posts combined with algorithms rewarding that content led forward-thinking brands to ask themselves a simple question when creating social content: \u201cWould you share it?\u201d\n\nHow to take smart risks with lo-fi social content\n\nLo-fi doesn\u2019t translate to low effort, nor is it a pass to be less thoughtful or strategic about your content. Here are four ways to create intentional lo-fi content that entertains and engages your audience:\n\nListen to your audience\n\nDo your research\u2014lo-fi content may not take as much time or budget to produce, but that doesn\u2019t absolve teams from strong planning. Social listening helps you get a firmer grasp on what your customers are talking about, both in general and as it relates to your brand. This Sweetgreen TikTok, for example, hooks viewers by immediately acknowledging pervasive feedback about their prices.\n\nKnow what differentiates your brand from direct and indirect competitors\n\nThis will help you pinpoint the right opportunities to bet on lo-fi social content and how to bring these moments to life. Getting this right depends on understanding the behaviors, norms and fandoms that are unique to your audience. Regional fast-food chain Culver\u2019s does this often, playing into their Wisconsin roots without formal voiceover or on-camera talent.\n\nBe real and show up as such\n\nMany consumers place greater value on brands that aren\u2019t buttoned up or picture-perfect all the time, especially on social. Karten recommends doing something as similar as posting an image dump with lo-fi imagery to show your brand\u2019s true colors or heritage.\n\nFor example, in the wake of its 2020 bankruptcy and subsequent brand turnaround, Brooks Brothers has leaned into a more casual approach on social\u2013with simple static posts reviving old catalogs and quick get-ready-with-me TikToks\u2014aimed at appealing to a younger generation of shoppers.\n\nCouple goals via Spring \u201881 catalog #tbt Posted by Brooks Brothers on Thursday, April 27, 2023\n\nPartner with influencers driving trends\n\nSharing your brand\u2019s platform with someone else always carries a certain amount of risk. But influencers and creators are masters of lo-fi content. Engaging and partnering with the originators of so many different social trends can have long-term benefits for brands.\n\nKarten spoke to an example from Cava, which partnered with The Devon Maid, a TikTok creator who was going viral for a video on how pasta shapes walk. The subsequent post, featuring The Devon Maid\u2019s take on how various Cava toppings would walk, over-performed in terms of both likes and shares. It allowed the brand to participate in the trend without stealing the idea from its original source.\n\nMake major announcements more relatable\n\nLarge corporate announcements may seem like the one arena where a lo-fi approach isn\u2019t worth the risk. But if the Tennessee Titans\u2019 2023 schedule release video is any indication, even this tide is turning.\n\nFor the announcement, the Titans produced two videos: One with high production value featuring celebrities including comedian Nate Bargatze, Jelly Roll and Keith Urban, the other, a lo-fi video asking random people in downtown Nashville to identify their 2023 opponents by their logo. The lo-fi version outperformed the more polished version significantly\u201482,000+ likes and 2,100+ comments compared to 15,000+ likes and 249 comments on Instagram alone, drawing engagement from major brands such as Cheetos and even teams on their schedule.\n\nWhy did it work? The Titans version was raw, it was real and, most importantly, it was hilarious.\n\nTo mitigate lo-fi content risks, never stop testing\n\nFor brands accustomed to full-fledged TV commercials, expensive out of home billboards and glossy print spreads, lo-fi social content may seem like a major marketing risk. But as the previous examples demonstrate, when done right the payoff is undeniable.\n\nMarketers looking to take bigger swings with lo-fi content should still take a test-and-learn approach to find the tone, format and timely references that resonate best with your audience.

In fact, teams that don\u2019t adopt automation and AI-powered software throughout their tech stack risk falling behind.\n\nThere has never been more customer, competitor or industry data available to marketing teams. And yet, with shrinking bandwidths, having the time to uncover insights from that vast sea of data is becoming less realistic.\n\nAt its core, automation cuts out redundant, time-consuming tasks so your team can focus on strategy. But with the right tools and processes, automation also breaks down silos and makes your whole business a well-oiled, data-driven machine. And while you\u2019re likely already using email automation, the capabilities of marketing automation extend to every discipline under the marketing umbrella.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll walk through what marketing automation is, how and why to use it and examples of tools.\n\nFeel free to jump ahead:\n\nWhat is marketing automation?\n\nMarketing automation is the process of speeding up repetitive, time-consuming and complex tasks with the power of automation software.\n\nAutomation tools are popular in marketing departments. They empower teams to uncover insights or connect with customers in a faster, smarter way\u2014all while offloading time-consuming tasks. Think: sending customer emails, SMS communications, scheduling social media posts, running digital ads and more.\n\nAs our Senior Manager of Marketing Operations Cam Conrad puts it, \u201cMarketing automation allows you to execute your marketing campaigns at scale. It gives you the ability to build repeatable processes and templates for things like emails, landing pages and webforms.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between email marketing and marketing automation?\n\nEmail marketing falls under the umbrella of marketing automation. But marketing automation is a lot broader and aims to streamline every corner of a marketing team. It includes automation strategies across marketing, including social media, digital advertising, segmentation, analytics and data measurement and yes, email marketing.\n\nWhy use marketing automation?\n\nWith automation tools, companies can target a larger range of customers and prospects across a range of channels. Many marketing teams rely on automation strategies to save their employees valuable time, improve workflows and enhance customer experience.\n\nAutomation also breaks down silos and smooths out collaboration within your team, and beyond. As Cam explains, \u201cBy centralizing all campaigns inside a marketing automation platform you can increase visibility across the marketing team.\u201d\n\nMarketing automation tools also assist with lead scoring, generation and nurturing, as well as measuring the ROI of campaigns.\n\nBenefits of these automated tools include:\n\nBetter customer experience: Setting up alerts and automating elements of customer care means users don\u2019t have to wait as long for support.\n\nSetting up alerts and automating elements of customer care means users don\u2019t have to wait as long for support.

Maintain brand consistency: Automated tools can maintain consistency around brand assets, email send times and content scheduling even when employees have a busy workload.\n\nAutomated tools can maintain consistency around brand assets, email send times and content scheduling even when employees have a busy workload. Better campaign measurements: Marketing automation tools often come with inbuilt ways to test the efficacy of your strategies.\n\nAutomation also empowers you to create marketing materials that are more personalized\u2014like targeting leads based on how warm they are, or based on a person\u2019s previous interactions with your brand.\n\nAnd the ability to personalize marketing materials will only become more important. According to McKinsey, 71% of consumers expect personalized interactions. And the majority of consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that use personalized communications.\n\nBringing the marketing automation process into your team\n\nYou already know marketing is not just one discipline. It\u2019s a combination of many key business operations and processes that impact and feed entire orgs.\n\nAdding a marketing automation process to each of these moving pieces helps your marketing team, and teams beyond, make better decisions with improved workflows. Let\u2019s explore how:\n\nHow does marketing automation work?\n\nAutomation in marketing works by applying technology to perform (and often expedite) routine processes with minimal human intervention.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a very basic breakdown of how the marketing automation process works, from start to finish:\n\nUnderstand and meet sales team needs\n\nDifferent customers have different needs depending on what stage of the funnel they\u2019re in. And when you have a lot of customers\u2014current or prospective\u2014keeping track of who falls into which category is nearly impossible.\n\nAutomation software streamlines the complex process of lead scoring, tracking customer touchpoints and determining where in the funnel customers fall.\n\nThis empowers your sales team to identify how to approach certain customers and helps marketing teams design more personalized, tailored messaging for the right audience segments.\n\nDefine your customer segments\n\nSegmentation categorizes your target audience into groups and lists based on specific factors, like job title, industry, buying intent and past interactions. Identifying these segments means you can create more personalized content and messaging at every touchpoint of the customer journey to warm up leads, re-engage with customers and more.\n\nThis could include identifying what industries your customers fall into and what tools they have in their tech stack. A small business segment will have different needs than mid-market or enterprise. And customers who use tools that integrate seamlessly with your product will respond to different messaging than those who don\u2019t already have integration-friendly products.\n\nCustomer segments can also be based on past interactions with your brand. Like whether someone has purchased from you, how engaged they are with your emails or past interactions with your customer care agents.\n\nSet up a strategy for success\n\nOnce you\u2019ve determined which customer segments to target, you can shape your strategy to determine how you want to reach your audience at different touchpoints\u2014while using automation to help you do so.\n\nThis is where you identify what type of outreach to conduct at every touchpoint of the customer journey\u2014and where automation fits in along the way.\n\nConsider the ads, social posts, emails and their triggers that will speak to each customer segment. From there, you can decide what content to create for each step of the customer journey.\n\nChoose the right content\n\nDifferent segments will require and respond to different messages and materials.\n\nOne way automation can help you is through A/B testing. For emails, this can identify what subject lines result in more clicks. For ads, A/B testing narrows down the best creative or copy to use.\n\nAutomating dynamic customer experiences can also personalize a customer journey. A tool like Uberflip creates custom web \u201cjourneys\u201d to show visitors content customized to their needs and industry.\n\nUse analytics and reporting to measure, test and improve strategies\n\nAutomation is a true game-changer here. It turns large data sets into actionable insights in seconds\u2014work that can be impossible to calculate manually.\n\nThis is crucial to improving your strategies. Here, automation helps you set data-driven SMART goals for your strategy. And, thanks to the speed of automation, you can measure, test and improve those strategies faster to stay agile.\n\nAutomation tools also break down silos by enabling cross-team data visibility. For example, after sifting through billions of social data points in seconds, Sprout\u2019s automation packages those insights in shareable reports to keep stakeholders looped in.\n\nWhat are examples of marketing automation?\n\nMarketing automation can take on many forms. You may use email, social media, audience analysis, workflow, analytics or advertising automation, or a combination of all of these.\n\nLet\u2019s see these automated processes in action throughout a marketing org and, hopefully, spark inspiration for your own team.\n\nEmail automation\n\nWhen we talk about automation, I\u2019m willing to bet that email marketing automation comes to mind first.\n\nAs your email list grows, so does the need for sophisticated software that manages complex lists and personalizes your communications by segment.\n\nEmail automation makes it easy to A/B test subject lines, segment your audience to reach the right people with the right messages, keep them engaged and measure your efforts.\n\nHere are some examples of email marketing automation:\n\nWelcome emails that automatically launch when a new subscriber signs up for your email list.\n\nthat automatically launch when a new subscriber signs up for your email list. Email newsletters that regularly send to customers.\n\nthat regularly send to customers.

Nurture campaigns to send to audiences based on whether they click on previous communications.\n\nto send to audiences based on whether they click on previous communications. Transactional emails such as order confirmation emails, shipping notifications and requests for product reviews after a product is received.\n\nSocial media automation\n\nBandwidth is one of the top challenges for social teams, according to The Sprout Social Index\u2122. And that bandwidth is only getting thinner.\n\nSocial media automation software takes repetitive, time-consuming tasks off social team members\u2019 plates so they can focus on strategy. This helps you stay more agile and proactive, minimizing monotonous tasks.\n\nSocial media automation software also saves time by empowering SMMs to manage all of their social accounts, content and data in one hub. For example, Sprout scales social media efforts, across your strategy\u2014from social customer care to scheduling and publishing content.\n\nHere are a few examples of what social media automation can do:\n\nSchedule content to publish automatically.\n\nto publish automatically. Funnel comments and messages from all of your social channels into a centralized hub.\n\nfrom all of your social channels into a centralized hub.

Customer service chatbots that answer common questions received on social for you and remove the task from your plate.\n\nAudience analysis automation\n\nWe\u2019ve all been served an ad or email that doesn\u2019t match our interests. Audience analysis helps prevent this.\n\nAudience analysis automation helps sort customers into the segments we mentioned earlier. These segments group customers based on past actions they have, or haven\u2019t, taken.\n\nHere are some examples of audience analysis automation:\n\nSorting leads based on how warm they are.\n\nbased on how warm they are. Segmenting email audiences based on how they interact with emails.\n\nbased on how they interact with emails. Targeting ad audiences based on their past interactions with your brand, and how close to a purchase they are.\n\nbased on their past interactions with your brand, and how close to a purchase they are. Demographics of your audience on social media like age and location.\n\nWorkflow automation\n\nAll automation improves day-to-day processes. But there are automation tools and features specifically built to streamline team and individual workflows.\n\n\u201cMarketing automation allows you to build workflows that span across different teams\u2019 domains.\u201d Cam explains. \u201cFor example, you can build a lead scoring model that will surface prospects that have been qualified by the marketing team to be passed to the sales team for follow up. These types of workflows and processes create a shared framework that marketing and sales strategies can be built around.\u201d\n\nThis can be as small scale as alerting team members when tasks have been completed in a project, or as large scale as ensuring top team efficiency.\n\nHere are some examples of workflow automation:\n\nProject management tools that automatically alert team members when projects have been updated, completed or added.\n\nthat automatically alert team members when projects have been updated, completed or added. Social media content tools , like Sprout\u2019s Message Approval Workflows, that aid team collaboration and content approvals.\n\n, like Sprout\u2019s Message Approval Workflows, that aid team collaboration and content approvals. Social media management tools that provide visibility into messages that have been responded to, or automatically send messages to the people and teams who need to see them, like Sprout\u2019s Tasks.\n\nAnalytics automation\n\nEvery organization should be data-driven. And more businesses are starting to warm up to this. According to The 2023 State of Social Media Report, over half of marketing leaders say that social media data and insights consistently inform their company\u2019s business strategy.\n\nThere has simply never been a time where we\u2019ve had so much data at the palm of our hands. But more data and touchpoints means larger data sets that can take hours or weeks to analyze.\n\nAnalytics automation does the heavy-lifting for you. It examines your digital data points and packages them in easy-to-read presentations, data visualizations and spreadsheets. AI-powered software can even make recommendations for you.\n\nHere are some examples of analytics automation:\n\nDynamic data dashboards in software like Tableau.\n\nin software like Tableau. Analytics tools that calculate large data sets in seconds.\n\nthat calculate large data sets in seconds.

Location-targeted ads that only display to those in a specific location.\n\nThe role of AI in automation\n\nAutomation is often confused for AI. And while the two make a powerful duo when used side-by-side, and often have crossover, they are different.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into the role of AI in marketing automation, and what makes AI and automation a dynamic duo.\n\nHow is AI used in automation\n\nAutomation is meant to help marketers make better decisions by doing monotonous tasks for them, faster. But AI relies on algorithms and massive amounts of data to help marketers solve problems, make more informed decisions and predict potential outcomes.\n\nWhen combined, AI-powered automation can offload some of your tasks, while also making data-informed suggestions or decisions for you. This combination further streamlines your work and helps you make smarter decisions.\n\nLet\u2019s look at social media publishing, for example. Automation enables you to schedule posts to automatically publish. But AI tools can help you further optimize that scheduled content. Sprout\u2019s Optimal Send Times uses data science to analyze your posting times, then suggests seven ideal times to post for optimal engagement.\n\nAn AI-powered tool can also accelerate your content creation process. Sprout\u2019s upcoming feature, Suggestions by AI Assist, will help social media managers break through writer\u2019s block and inspire new ideas with social copy recommendations.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about what automation can do for you, your team and your business. But to start using automation, you need the right tools. Marketing automation tools are types of software that conduct automation processes for you. Examples include Sprout Social, Hubspot, Adobe Marketo Engage, Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement and Zapier.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the tools that are right for you, Cam suggests having a clear idea of what you\u2019re hoping to accomplish with it. \u201cThere is a wide set of features available across different tools. Knowing your primary objectives will help you select the best fit. And bring stakeholders from other teams into the evaluation process\u2014especially the team that owns CRM. Having their input from the jump saves a lot of headaches when you get to the implementation stage.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go through some of the stand-out tools out there, and highlights from each of them.\n\n1. Sprout Social\n\nWe\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention our very own automation and AI-powered platform.

Salesforce Marketing Cloud Account Engagement\n\nSalesforce is a giant when it comes to marketing and sales automation tools and platforms.\n\nThe Salesforce Marketing Cloud automates and scales marketing on the B2B level and is mostly meant for enterprise-level teams and businesses.\n\nMarketing Cloud features a full spread of features that streamline marketing from end to end.

All you need to do is look for patterns in what your audience finds compelling and tailor your content strategy accordingly.\n\nFor on-the-fly action items, we recommend conducting a brief start-stop-continue analysis of your Instagram performance data. This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of content and determines what actions to start, stop or continue.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this type of spontaneous analysis is designed to provide quick takes on your Instagram strategy\u2019s effectiveness, such as whether people reacted positively to a particular post.\n\nFor more complex questions, like determining the best time to post on Instagram, you\u2019ll want to use a more advanced social media management tool. For example, Sprout customers can take advantage of ViralPost\u00ae technology, which analyzes audience engagement patterns and content preferences to detect the most active times for authentic engagement.\n\nTrack growth and engagement trends\n\nA quick dip into the Insights tool is all you need to do to ensure you\u2019re pacing well toward your monthly performance targets.

That way, you can make strategic adjustments to stay on track toward achieving your desired outcomes.\n\nMake stronger paid marketing decisions\n\nDid you know that 50% of users become more interested in a brand after seeing an ad for it on Instagram? With these types of results, making every dollar count is critical.\n\nUse Instagram Insights to optimize your paid performance so you can make better use of your budget.\n\nAnalyze your organic content performance to identify trends, themes and creative elements that resonate with your audience.

Keeping up with all the changes is one thing. Understanding how they impact your social media strategy is a different beast entirely.\n\nNext time you hear about a rumored or confirmed algorithm update, use Instagram Insights to see how your strategy is weathering through the change. If everything is going according to plan, then you\u2019re good to go. If you notice any performance dips, it\u2019s time to investigate further using a tool that can provide a more comprehensive analysis.\n\nUse Instagram Insights to create a picture-perfect social strategy\n\nInstagram\u2019s landscape is constantly changing. Trends come and go quickly, and what\u2019s popular today may not be tomorrow.

The only way to grow and stay ahead is a keen eye on what your customers are saying about their interests and pain points.\n\nIn a world where star ratings can make or break a brand, review analysis is your north star. It gives you deep insights from customer feedback so you can uncover trends, make targeted improvements to your business and build a richer brand management strategy.\n\nTo conduct review analysis effectively, you need to focus on the right platforms and choose the right review analysis tool. Only then will you get the most comprehensive view of your audience.\n\nIn this article, you\u2019ll find out what review analysis is all about, the tangible business benefits, as well as a step-by-step breakdown of how to build a review management strategy to grow your business.\n\nWhat is review analysis?\n\nReview analysis is the process of analyzing customer feedback from various sources such as social listening data, review forums, customer service data and surveys to get targeted brand insights. These insights enable you to cut through the noise and understand how customers feel about your business, products and service so you can improve them proactively.\n\nWhy should brands carry out review analysis?\n\nReviews give first-hand information on how to improve your offerings, create better-performing content and build more authentic, meaningful relationships that boost brand loyalty. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nCreate more impactful content\n\nReview analysis reveals what type of content resonates the most with your audience, which will help you deliver more relevant social posts for better engagement.\n\nIt also gives you an opportunity to insert your brand into the conversations drawing audience\u2019s attention.\n\nReview analytics tools like Sprout analyze content across multiple social channels and profiles simultaneously. This gives you rich, holistic brand insights across key performance indicators (KPIs) to fortify your social strategy, as Benefits Cosmetics found when analyzing this data to learn more about their audience.\n\nBoost sales conversions\n\nSocial proof is everything. Think about it\u2014if you want to buy a product or service, the first thing you do is look up reviews to see what other customers are saying about it.\n\nPrice may be an important factor but product quality, after-sales service and how competing brands compare, are important too. Review analysis gives you insights into all these factors so you can improve your end-to-end customer journey for higher satisfaction and conversion.\n\nManage brand reputation\n\nWith rising consumer awareness, brands need to make sure they are always fostering a positive brand reputation. Not being proactive can lead to grim repercussions as fast fashion retailers are learning the hard way.\n\nReview analysis guides you toward the things that strengthen and weaken your brand image. These could be product issues, advertising campaigns, customer service or even sensitive issues gaining ground. According to The Sprout Social Index\u2122 2022, 34% of customers believe it\u2019s important for brands to speak out to remain culturally relevant.\n\nSocial listening enables you to track thousands of direct mentions and comments across social networks to identify what\u2019s resonating with your audiences, to build a positive brand perception, like the Atlanta Hawks did, with Sprout.\n\nImprove customer experience\n\nReview analysis is a great way to understand your customers\u2019 emotional triggers so you can prioritize areas you need to improve or nurture.\n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to ask for feedback from your audience. It\u2019s a great way to nurture customer engagement and it gives your brand a more human touch. Here are some tips on how to ask for reviews.\n\nGain competitive intelligence\n\nReview analytics also provides you with insights on competitor brands, from how your competitors\u2019 social posts are faring, to how you compare on customer satisfaction benchmarks. Competitor analysis tools, like Sprout, aggregate this data into ready-to-use reports for fast insights into your industry position.\n\nTrack emerging market trends\n\nMonitoring trending topics on social media, forums like Reddit and review sites like Google My Business (GMB) gives you insights into what\u2019s top-of-mind for customers. Track comments using keywords or hashtags and analyze them in real-time or historically. Doing this will help you future-proof your strategies so you are well-prepared to take on market dynamics.\n\nTop sources of customer review data\n\nCustomers leave product and brand reviews on almost all social platforms. What\u2019s important is that you decide which ones are most relevant to your business. Ask: Where do your customers mostly go to express themselves?\n\nTo get you started, here are some popular ones, which you can also track with Sprout.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook reviews or recommendations are where customers share their experiences with you in detail. These are visible on your business page and appear in the user\u2019s news feeds when they ask for recommendations.\n\nYelp\n\nYelp is a popular platform where customers write about their experiences with local businesses, as well as make reservations or purchases.\n\nGoogle My Business\n\nGMB is another popular platform for local businesses to gain customer feedback. Regularly updating your content and information on the platform also helps your search rankings.\n\nYou can directly post to your GMB account using Sprout and simultaneously collect and analyze all your reviews to draw insights.\n\nTripAdvisor\n\nWith more than one billion reviews for over eight million businesses, TripAdvisor is a go-to for planning a vacation.

Analyzing this data is the best way to measure the success of your employer branding to attract a richer talent pool.\n\nHow to analyze online reviews in 4 steps\n\nWhile you can sift through customer reviews manually, review management tools help you do so quickly and efficiently. They dig into thousands of comments across platforms and social networks simultaneously to find insights that can be easily missed when doing so manually.\n\nSprout enables you to identify, organize and respond to customer reviews from a number of social channels and other sources including Facebook, Google My Business, Yelp, TripAdvisor and Glassdoor.

Social media manager. Brand manager. Senior director of campaign strategy. Director of social and partnerships. Unicorn.\n\nHis interest and talents in social emerged early. Wolfley points to the nostalgic days of internet angst for many: MySpace. Writing emo poetry on MySpace notes revealed a passion for creative writing. His passion led him to earning a degree in advertising and launching social media accounts for new chapters of his international fraternity, Phi Delta Theta.\n\nIn 2012 while working and traveling for Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters, he launched The Traveling Unicorn, an Instagram account documenting his journeys\u2014but in a unicorn mask. His creative priorities shifted from managing The Traveling Unicorn account to his career when he joined MeUndies. But he\u2019ll always be a unicorn at heart, whether he\u2019s posting or not.\n\nIn 2014, Wolfley joined MeUndies as a customer experience specialist where he talked to strangers about their underwear, a catalyst to launching his formal social career. At MeUndies, Wolfley became the company\u2019s first Social Lead, eventually becoming Brand Manager. He was also a director for Ubiquitous, an influencer marketing agency, and Canoo, an electric vehicle startup. He\u2019s currently the Director of Social Media and Partnerships at Flock Freight.\n\nBut across all of these career milestones and titles, a common thread emerges when it comes to Wofley\u2019s perspective: disruption as a path to professional and brand evolution.\n\nI spoke with Wolfley to learn more about his career and the importance of disrupting industries to uncover innovative opportunities. We talked about his approach to marketing through award-winning content like the \u201cDefine Your Load\u201d campaign with Steve Burns, which earned a Cannes Lion for B2B Creative in the Challenger Brand category in June 2023. Along with campaigns, we discussed making risks on social and his views on innovation, like artificial intelligence.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Flock Freight (@flock)\n\nWhat are some of your social media hot takes?\n\nEvery generation will have its own social media platform. For my generation, Millennials, the majority of us will be primarily on Instagram. My parents are on Facebook, Gen Z is on TikTok. What\u2019s next? It will come.\n\nWhat is your favorite Traveling Unicorn moment?\n\nIt was the first time I popped up on the Instagram Explore page, the old-school one, where it only showed nine posts. It was my first piece of video content too. The content was absurd and the engagement it started receiving was something I had never seen with anything I had produced before.\n\nI was dumping a bunch of chips and Cheetos into my unicorn mouth and it was kind of like this voyeur-esque pan into the room from the hallway. It\u2019s just this unicorn eating all of these chips and dumping them all over its face. Big mess, but obviously for the content. Shout out to my best friend for filming it and helping me clean up.\n\nI think it was probably one of the first moments that gave me an early signal that I had figured something out and the account could grow.\n\nAnother favorite moment was being recognized by people at music festivals. I would have the unicorn head on a big totem at the Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra Music Festival or other events, and when someone would come up and ask if I was the Traveling Unicorn, it was like, \u201cOh, wow, I made it. Am I famous?\u201d Obviously not, but it was a cool feeling.\n\nWhy is disruption important to you and why is it so relevant today?\n\nDisruption comes from innovation. If we don\u2019t innovate, there\u2019s complacency and stagnation. It\u2019s important to me to find career opportunities with brands that align with my own personal mentality and attitude toward disruption.\n\nI want to ensure those are connected or running parallel with each other because you always have to have a similar balance in social media. If we publish the same kind of content for three, to six, to 12 months, what performed the prior month or quarter might not perform the same today. You have to stay on your toes and continually consider what you can do differently. What are the trends? What are the different formats that we can use to engage community or produce content?\n\nThat daily disruption includes the things we can implement to keep getting better and connect more and more with our followers and community.\n\nYour mantra of disruptive innovation is shown in Flock Freight\u2019s recent \u2018Define Your Load\u2019 campaign, which features an unlikely nostalgic spokesperson. Why Steve from Blue\u2019s Clues for the campaign?\n\nOne element of choosing talent was data on our target audiences. We have two primary segments: shippers and carriers who are ages 30-55. For this campaign we wanted to target the shipper segment and those individuals working in supply chain and logistics positions at brands. At first, we were thinking more of an investigative journalist from Dateline or 20/20.\n\nWe tried reaching out to those investigative journalists, but most were under contract with shows\u2014many of which were a little more conservative and didn\u2019t approve of the amount of cursing proposed in our campaign scripts.\n\nBut, we couldn\u2019t cut the cursing out. Even with the bleeps, we had to roll with the creative concept because we believed in it so much. With our creative partners, we went back to the drawing board thinking through other investigative-type personalities out there, and Steve from Blue\u2019s Clues was one of those options.\n\nI wasn\u2019t the person that came up with Steve, but when I heard the idea I knew it had legs because we could do so much more on social media. There was more reach and notoriety. And it definitely came through with the results of the campaign, the response and the overall sentiment.\n\nA year prior to the \u2018Define Your Load\u2019 campaign, Steve Burns came back into the limelight out of nowhere. I think we all remember that moment. I was even one of those guys who thought Steve Burns died.\n\nFor folks who recognized Steve Burns, adding in the cursing element had shock value. There were some people that didn\u2019t recognize him, but when they did, it was the perfect surprise and delight moment for viewers.\n\nFlock Freight\u2019s \u2018Truck Stop Talks\u2019 and \u2018Humans of Trucking\u2019 provide a glimpse into the lives of professional freight drivers and none of the interviews are scheduled. Can you elaborate on your approach to marketing in a unique way?\n\nThink of Flock Freight like a marketplace. We\u2019re bringing carriers and shippers together with our patented shared truckload technology that rideshares freight on empty truck trailer space. We work with some really cool brands, but we can only do so much in co-marketing with those companies that ship with us. When we go that route, we\u2019re talking a lot about [Flock Freight]: the results the shippers experienced, the partnership and the benefits that our technology unlocks for those shippers.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Flock Freight (@flock)\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s a lot of \u2018us\u2019 talking about \u2018us.\u2019 Those case studies are very valuable for Flock Freight, but on social, talking about ourselves all the time doesn\u2019t resonate. In order to differentiate and bring a fresh approach to our social strategy, we did an analysis of all the other players (peers and competitors) in the logistics and supply chain space. Some trucking companies recognize drivers in certain ways, but they don\u2019t do deep storytelling. In this niche, there are online communities like Facebook Groups and sub Reddits where carriers and professional truck drivers talk to each other. While analyzing these, a few themes came out that gave us insight to go this way.\n\nIn these online communities, carriers and drivers exchange stories and experiences, good or bad banter and confide with each other about day-to-day challenges and the pros and cons of the profession. Additionally, we learned that for the average person who is not in logistics or transportation, their primary interactions with truck drivers are on the road and their perception is negative because it\u2019s often related to a semi-truck that\u2019s in their way or slowing them down.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Flock Freight (@flock)\n\nBut there\u2019s a human behind that wheel and in the cab of that semi truck. They have a story. They have a family. They have challenges, interests and hobbies most people don\u2019t know about. The whole essence of \u2018Truck Stop Talks\u2019 and \u2018Humans of Trucking\u2019 is to humanize professional truck drivers, show appreciation for their hardships and experiences\u2014the things they do to keep the entire supply chain moving. Anything and everything that\u2019s in our houses or offices was on a truck at some point.\n\nThose insights showed us we had an opportunity to tell these stories in a fun, yet meaningful way. There\u2019s a mix of tones, which we love because there are opportunities for truck drivers to relate when they find and consume this content.\n\nEven for folks outside of our industry, people can always relate to or find inspiration, education, and value from human stories.\n\nMany B2B brands are concerned about proving the ROI of social. How can social teams and marketing leaders make a case for bigger risks?\n\nThere is no silver bullet to getting buy-in for risks\u2014big or small.\n\nIt\u2019s all about taking insights and if you lead with insights, you\u2019re already headed in the right direction. Insights are the cornerstone to the foundation for social media strategy and content pillars. For new content or risks, track the early signals, like engagement, but qualitative signals are just as important, too. With a combination of both quantitative and qualitative positive signals, those can give you the permission for similar types of content or tactics.\n\nI believe professionals working at B2B companies often get in their own way, overcomplicate how they market their product or service and think because they\u2019re B2B, they have to be buttoned up and can only go to market a certain way. I saw this simple post from Jacob Shipley on LinkedIn and he captured my thinking perfectly: Social media isn\u2019t B2B or B2C. It\u2019s P2P. At the end of the day, we\u2019re people talking to people. Don\u2019t talk to businesses about a product. Talk to people about their problems.\n\nI don\u2019t know who needs to hear this but organic social\u2019s primary role in the funnel is the top\u2013awareness. Will \u2018Trucks Stop Talks\u2019 or \u2018Humans of Trucking\u2019 convert a new shipper or carrier to work with Flock? That would be awesome, but probably not. However, it allows us to step outside of the \u201cconference room bore core\u201d that most B2B companies get stuck in and instead, tap into emotional storytelling, which can be so powerful in terms of brand awareness and recall.\n\nGoing back to Jacob Shipley, it\u2019s about people to people. No matter if they\u2019re working in a business, looking for a new supplier or a vendor, if you\u2019re able to market to them as a person, you\u2019re already going to be well ahead of the competition. That\u2019s included in the layer of risks that we\u2019re taking, big or small.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to create social media content that provides value to the end viewer or consumer and using emotional storytelling\u2014that\u2019s what people connect with. Within social, you have to learn fast. You have to understand what early signals happen and how to leverage or weigh them.\n\nI think back to growing the Traveling Unicorn into a pretty large account in the early days of Instagram, and I recognized those signals quickly. I tested and experimented a lot with the Traveling Unicorn, MeUndies, and Canoo. All the wins and learnings from those experiences have given me the insights and confidence to continue to take risks.\n\nCan you speak to balancing quantitative and qualitative data when sharing insights with social teams?\n\nYes, metrics are great, but you need layers. I think follower growth, impressions and then the health of those impressions using engagement rate should always be considered, but don\u2019t harp on them.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll have one of those posts where you\u2019re like, \u201cThis is going to crush. We nailed the creative.\u201d That post goes live and 24 hours later it\u2019s way below performance expectations, but there might be a signal or two within it that gives you some idea to keep going.\n\nThere could be a comment that really touched somebody. Every time there\u2019s a comment with that positive sentiment, there\u2019s probably a handful (if not more) of people that thought the same, but they just didn\u2019t comment.\n\nYou always have to have that balance between quantitative and qualitative data with any kind of social reporting. It\u2019s really tough in any aspect of marketing to not fall into paralysis by analysis.\n\nDon\u2019t overcomplicate it. Go back to your gut belief. Give it more time, or do another test to see if you get similar results or make some tweaks for the next piece of similar content.\n\nFor the Steve Burns campaign, we had a lot of quantitative metrics we were tracking, but the validation and success of the campaign really came from the qualitative metrics, primarily the comments, shares and the sentiment within those comments and shares.\n\nI\u2019d be lying to you if I said prior to the campaign launching that we didn\u2019t ask ourselves the questions, \u201cIs this too much? Is this going to land with our audience?\u201d But what gave us that boost of certainty we needed was sharing the creative with all of Flock\u2019s teams to get feedback, and of course leadership was one of those teams. I wish I was in those executive leadership team meetings when our chief marketing officer was sharing the scripts and then ultimately the final videos. It would have been great content capturing those conversations and reactions.\n\nWhat other advice would you have for marketing leaders when it comes to creating a social presence?\n\nPeople who are in social media leadership positions have been in the game for a long time and they all started somewhere. They started on Instagram, Vine and Facebook for companies in the early days.\n\nAs you level up, you start to get more removed from the trenches. Social customer care, community management and social in general are changing every single day. Features, trends, how to leverage platforms\u2014don\u2019t remove yourself from those trenches, or else social media is going to leave you behind.\n\nMy advice for people in social media leadership positions would be to continue consuming social media, saving awesome campaigns, bubbling up trends and engaging with your community. Keep your ear to the ground on what\u2019s happening.\n\nAlso, whether it\u2019s on your personal account or a burner account of some sort, still be out there creating because that\u2019s where you can test and learn the most. Then you can apply what you learned to your brand\u2019s social media strategy.\n\nIn social, you can only control what you put out there. You can\u2019t really control how it performs because of the algorithms, what\u2019s in your followers\u2019 feeds that day, etc. At the end of the day, put your best foot forward with the things you can control: strategy, creative production, etc.\n\nIf the content is based on insights, brings your followers value and it\u2019s pushing your brand forward, then hit that \u201cpost\u201d button.\n\nWhat advice would you give to social media managers who are in the trenches managing these sophisticated social presences?\n\nDo your sweeps, plan your content, experiment.\n\nWhen I tell people I work in social media, people will say I\u2019m on Instagram, TikTok and Twitter all day\u2013which I am, and I learn something new every day. This space doesn\u2019t slow down and it\u2019s fun!\n\nAt times social media can be overwhelming and exhausting. I still have those days even with currently managing the smallest audience I\u2019ve managed in my career so far. Take advantage of your notification settings, really leverage the features so you don\u2019t go crazy and manage expectations with your manager for when you\u2019re on and offline. It\u2019s the very small, granular things that can give you longevity with a career in social media.\n\nCreate offline expectations with your manager or team, so you\u2019re able to disconnect. It\u2019s a grind and we all have experienced social media dopamine. Something performs really well, it\u2019s the highest high. Two days later, something doesn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s the lowest low and it can take a toll on you\u2014but that cycle is going to continue no matter what.\n\nThat\u2019s why I keep saying don\u2019t overly sweat metrics or else you\u2019ll just drive yourself crazy and hate working in social media.\n\nYou\u2019ve worn many hats. How have you navigated the different challenges in these various roles? How did you recognize your wins and areas of improvement?\n\nAcross all of these industries, I\u2019ve always wanted to do things differently. When I came into these industries\u2014underwear, automotive, freight and logistics\u2014they were ripe for disruption.\n\nIn underwear, the only players at the time were Victoria\u2019s Secret and Calvin Klein. MeUndies was doing something differently with their men\u2019s underwear subscription. There was an opportunity to market differently. Instead of over-sexualized content and imagery, there was an opportunity to market by creating community and connection through body positivity and a new form of confidence. The electrification and digitalization of vehicles created the opportunity to be different in the automotive space as well.\n\nThat\u2019s how I decide what brands I work for. If a brand wants to be in the sea of sameness, I\u2019ll pass on riding that boat.\n\nSomething else I\u2019ve learned throughout my career no matter the company or industry: you need to provide value on social media to your ideal or current followers. And that\u2019s not by being like everyone else. That is how I\u2019ve been able to navigate and find success.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, always wanting to try something different isn\u2019t easy and creates challenges. There\u2019s a learning curve for every industry and I love the challenge to learn the ins and outs as quickly as possible. When I\u2019ve changed industries I ask myself: How quickly can I understand this space, the pain points, the benefits and the value my new company offers, etc?\n\nSocial already moves fast and with technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), things are changing even quicker. What is your advice for building a sustainable career in social?\n\nBe ready for change and embrace it. There are tools out there that will help you be more efficient. AI is one of those, in a variety of capacities.\n\nAI is like the dishwasher or washing machine in our homes. Think of all of the time you save not washing dishes or clothes by hand. Because of these tools, you can do more impactful things because those tools are able to do things a bit more quickly for you. That\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about AI.\n\nThere\u2019s all the conversation about AI taking jobs, but I think it\u2019s also going to create a lot of jobs. I believe there will always be a human element to social media, but the industry will leverage AI like an assistant or tool. Social pros should be ready to test and embrace tools of innovation that make them more efficient so they can focus on the more impactful things.\n\nFor example, in the social sphere, think about managing social media without Sprout\u2014scheduling posts, listening, all of that. Sprout is a tool that makes life so much easier for someone in social and I think AI is going to do the same.\n\nTo learn more about navigating your career journey, read our guide on what it takes to build a long-term career in social, based on advice from three social media executives.", "date": "2023-06-27"}, {"link": "https://sproutsocial.com/insights/omnichannel-customer-experience/", "title": "Omnichannel customer experience: exploring seamless customer journeys", "content": "Enhanced customer satisfaction, high customer engagement, and increased revenue are good reasons to develop an omnichannel customer experience.

Every positive experience fosters loyalty and encourages customers to become brand advocates.\n\nOptimized Resource Allocation: Implementing an effective omnichannel strategy allows businesses to optimize resource allocation by identifying the most impactful channels to invest the most effort. This helps companies to streamline operations, reduce costs, and increase profit.\n\nImplementing an effective omnichannel strategy allows businesses to optimize resource allocation by identifying the most impactful channels to invest the most effort. This helps companies to streamline operations, reduce costs, and increase profit. Creates a consistent brand experience: An integrated customer experience provides a consistent brand experience for users across every touchpoint, whether chatting with a customer support agent over the phone or visiting a physical store.\n\nAn integrated customer experience provides a consistent brand experience for users across every touchpoint, whether chatting with a customer support agent over the phone or visiting a physical store. Enable teams to pivot quickly and make data-driven decisions: Businesses adopting an integrated experience use analytics and customer behavior data to personalize customer journeys and introduce new features.\n\nIncreased revenue by improving customer retention and attracting new customers: When businesses understand customers, it\u2019s easier to address their pain points, anticipate their needs, and build products that meet their expectations.\n\nUnlocking the advantages of an omnichannel approach\n\nApart from integrating multiple channels to provide a frictionless experience, an omnichannel approach can impact your business in other ways:\n\n1. Create a Seamless customer journey from pre-purchase to post-purchase\n\nInterrupted transitions in the customer journey create friction, frustrate customers, and disrupt their user experience. In an omnichannel experience, customers can easily switch between channels and enjoy continuity, resulting in a more enjoyable journey.\n\n2. High customer retention and loyalty due to accurate segmentation and personalization.\n\nOmnichannel experiences provide a complete picture of the customer across multiple channels so that brands can have a unified view of their interactions and history. Leverage this data to segment customers and create a personalized experience based on their unique needs, preferences, and behaviors.\n\n3. Supports multi-channel engagement within a single interaction\n\nOn average, 51% of companies use at least eight channels to interact with customers, including emails, social media, websites, phones, live chat, and in-store. An omnichannel experience allows consumers to reach out to companies on their preferred channels and receive a quick and helpful response from a customer service expert.\n\n4. Create a consistent customer experience across any channel to reduce customer effort.\n\nEmbracing an omnichannel approach creates a consistent experience across channels. This means customers can trust that they will receive a similar level of service, quality, convenience, and information regardless of the channel they use. This way, it\u2019s easy to eliminate variations in the customer journey, making it an effortless and frictionless experience.\n\n5. Increased revenue due to higher customer engagement, more conversions, and more sales\n\nWhen customers have a positive experience, they actively interact and engage with the business. This creates more opportunities for brands to create deeper customer connections and build product loyalty.\n\nOmnichannel vs. multichannel: unveiling the key differences\n\nOmnichannel and multichannel are strategies for communicating with customers, with two distinct goals.\n\nThe term \u201comnichannel\u201d translates as \u201cavailable in all channels,\u201d meaning that a customer can switch between any sales channel, like a website or a physical store, and still get a consistent brand experience. Multichannel means \u201cmany channels,\u201d meaning customers can interact with many channels, but their experience isn\u2019t unified.\n\nOmnichannel focuses on the customer and utilizes every available channel to provide a seamless experience, whereas multichannel focuses on the product and uses multiple channels to promote it.\n\nImplementing an omnichannel experience requires data synchronization of customer history and alignment between teams to eliminate channel gaps. On the other hand, multichannels operate independently within their respective silos, sometimes resulting in disjointed touchpoints.\n\nBuilding a cohesive customer experience across channels\n\nThere\u2019s no hard rule for building a cohesive omnichannel customer experience. However, there are practical tips and strategies you can follow to help you build a successful one.\n\n1. Understand your customer\u2019s expectations.\n\nThere\u2019s no better place to start with customer experience than to understand your customers\u2019 wants and needs. An omnichannel strategy aims to create a positive experience, and failing to understand the customer will result in a misalignment between a business and its customers.\n\nTo understand your customers, build buyer personas to represent the attributes of your most engaged audience and collect data on their behavioral patterns, preferences, demographics, and needs.\n\nDepending on your customer base, you may have sufficient data from existing customers to create a comprehensive persona. Otherwise, refer to your preliminary research or contact prospective customers for meaningful insights.\n\n2. Chart the path of the customer journey\n\nIdentify the key milestones and touchpoints customers encounter throughout their journey and categorize them based on the stages of the customer journey (pre-purchase to post-purchase). This will help identify where an omnichannel experience can be implemented, such as a live chat pop-up.\n\nSimply put, customer touchpoints are every interaction that a customer has with a brand through a website, social media, or physical stores. Use a visual tool like Miro to organize your data, capture the entire journey (including the stages, touchpoints, emotions, motivations, and pain points), and map the current state of your existing customers.\n\nOnce your customer journey map is complete, analyze it for patterns and trends to identify high friction points, opportunities for personalization, and potential gaps in your marketing or sales funnel.\n\n3. Amplifying insights through customer feedback\n\nWhether good or bad, customer feedback plays a huge role in optimizing your omnichannel customer experience. Listening to what customers say about their experience will help you identify areas for improvement. You can collect customer feedback through the following:\n\nRun user feedback surveys to gather contextual insights from existing customers.\n\nUse a social listening tool like Sprout Social to capture conversations that people are having about your brand on social media.\n\nConducting interviews with individual users or focus groups\n\nAnalyze customer support tickets and online reviews to get insight into satisfaction levels.\n\nTalk to stakeholders who regularly interact with customers.\n\n4. Harnessing appropriate technologies for success\n\nManaging customer data across multiple channels can be challenging, especially if you have a huge customer base or a complex product. This is where businesses must leverage advanced technology.\n\nIntegration and automation are at the core of an omnichannel experience. Consider integrating multiple technologies like customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing automation tools, omnichannel communication platforms, and data analytics.\n\nCRMs like Salesforce can help you store and manage customer data, like contact information, purchase history, and behavior across multiple channels, to personalize your product offerings.\n\nUse automation software to automate and optimize your omnichannel marketing campaign across different platforms. Chatbots also provide instant and automated responses to customers\u2019 queries, so they don\u2019t wait for long.\n\n5. Identifying key stakeholders in the process\n\nDelivering a cohesive omnichannel customer experience becomes easier when all parties are aligned and working towards a similar goal.\n\nBy identifying key stakeholders (both internal and external) early on, you can involve them in the planning and implementation to get them on the same page regarding brand image consistency. This can help prevent any issues or delays down the line.\n\nSegment their roles, rights, security, and access so each stakeholder can play their part. Involving stakeholders can help you build buy-in and support for the omnichannel strategy, which can be crucial for success.\n\n6. Optimize your post-purchase experience\n\nAfter making a purchase, ensure that customers don\u2019t feel alone in figuring out how to use your product. Why not take a step further by optimizing your post-purchase experience?\n\nYou can send out personalized recommendations on how to use their new purchase. A great example is Dossier, a perfume brand that sends personalized tips to help customers smell nicer for longer.\n\nEnhancing the omnichannel customer experience\n\nHere\u2019s how to enhance or elevate your omnichannel strategy to create an exceptional customer experience before, during, and after purchasing.\n\nUnderstand your customers for targeted engagement.\n\nTo truly understand your customers, go beyond analyzing data points. Customers have unique likes, intentions, and needs, which vary depending on innovations, seasons, or trends. Actively engage with them. Learn to delight and excite them without overwhelming them. Tools like Sprout\u2019s social media engagement tool help you understand what customers expect from you and how to address them.\n\nComplement your market research with data sources. Look through social media analytics to see how customers use your products or services and what content resonates with them the most.\n\nLearn from industry leaders\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to learn about building an omnichannel experience; quite a different ball game to build a successful one. Why not start by learning from industry leaders?\n\nThese are companies that have a successful track record of creating seamless experiences across their channels. Take Starbucks, for example. On the surface, they\u2019re like any other coffee shop, but with an immersive omnichannel strategy, they transformed their brand into an $80 billion business.\n\nPick the top 2-3 successful companies in your industry. Study their strategies and approaches to gain insight into their omnichannel\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. For example, how do they interact with their audience on social media? This will help you know what to capitalize on and what common pitfalls to avoid.\n\nEnhance mobile capabilities\n\nAt least 85% of time spent on smartphones is spent using apps. Many customers interact with brands through smartphones, so businesses must optimize their mobile capabilities. This covers your apps\u2019 functionality, performance, responsiveness, design, and security.\n\nBy enhancing mobile capabilities, brands can leverage mobile-specific features for more personalization. Features like location-based offers and push notifications can deliver personalized and contextually relevant content to users, enhancing the omnichannel experience.\n\nSecure support\n\nProviding an omnichannel experience with the right customer support increases the effectiveness of your strategy. When customers encounter an issue, like a bug, make it easy to resolve by providing user-friendly support channels.\n\nLooking to create omnichannel support? Here are some ideas to help you:\n\nCreate a knowledge base to help customers find answers to questions, guides, or troubleshooting instructions.\n\nUse cutting-edge technologies like chatbots to give personalized responses.\n\nProvide email support so customers can send their queries and receive personalized responses.\n\nLive chat with a customer service rep\n\nCreate an online community where customers can ask questions and get help from a company rep or other members.\n\nPhone chat, sms messaging, or video chat.\n\nStreamline response times\n\nFast response time is an important attribute of an effective omnichannel strategy. Based on our Sprout Social Index, we found that 59% of customers expect a fast response to their queries within two hours.\n\nStreamlining response times can help:\n\nReduce wait time and distribute support volume to prevent individual channels from getting bombarded with tickets.\n\nAlert customer service agents of customers\u2019 intentions and previous actions for a faster resolution time\n\nUsing a tool like Sprout\u2019s Smart Inbox, customer care teams can manage incoming messages from multiple platforms, prioritize responses, and access important customer data, all in one place.\n\nEvaluate content for consistent messaging\n\nMaintaining consistent messaging across all channels helps reinforce your brand identity, so anyone who comes across an ad, a social post, or a landing page understands your product.\n\nEvery channel has unique features and limitations, and each caters to a diverse audience that consumes content in varying formats. You want to keep your messaging consistent across each channel but not identical to avoid redundancy.\n\nA good example is how Starbucks adapts its content to fit the context of its social channels when introducing the Java Mint Frappuccino. Their Instagram post comes with a short video and an even shorter copy to introduce the flavor excitingly.\n\nTheir content is much longer on Facebook because the audience reads more content. Each flavor is introduced with colorful emojis alongside images to match the flavor.\n\nSo, how do you evaluate content for consistent messaging? One way is to create a content calendar to monitor content regularly. Sprout\u2019s content calendar includes tools that help you curate your social media calendar and collaborate with teams outside of marketing.\n\nExtend omnichannel strategies offline\n\nYour omnichannel strategy must extend beyond online channels for customers to have a fully immersive experience. Someone should be able to start their shopping experience online and pick up where they left off when interacting with your physical store.\n\nEven with different channels, offline extensions allow channel integrations so customers can transition smoothly between touchpoints without losing context. By expanding your omnichannel strategies offline, you broaden your reach, tap into a larger audience, and reach customers who don\u2019t have an active online presence.\n\nTransform In-Store Experiences\n\nUnlike online shopping, an in-store experience is more personal and emotional for customers. Elevate your customers\u2019 shopping experience by combining decorative and visual elements, including the right colors, layouts, lighting, and music.\n\nMore importantly, provide great customer service. As soon as a customer walks into your store, let them easily find a company rep that can answer their questions and help them find what they\u2019re looking for. When brands provide great service, happy customers will spread the word.\n\nSelect Channels Strategically\n\nTruth is, you can choose to start building an omnichannel experience on all channels, but that would require a huge commitment. Surviving on every channel is almost impossible, so pick one and build from there. Dig into social analytics to identify the social channel with the highest engagement and optimize it.\n\nSprout\u2019s audience listening tool can also help you research the type of content your audience is consuming, what your competitors are doing, and, most importantly, how you can do better.\n\nMaintain consistency across the customer journey\n\nTo remain consistent, you need clear policies and values that your brand must be known for. Document this in a brand-style guide to get every team on the same page and present a unified vision of your company to the public.\n\nSome components of your brand style guide include the mission statement, typography, color palette, and common vocabulary. Go into the tiniest details. For example, if your brand is known for sustainability, it must reflect your choice of materials or color. Also, organize training sessions to help your staff understand your style guide. Every employee must understand what the brand stands for and their role in protecting it.\n\nExamples of successful omnichannel experiences\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gone through the basics of an omnichannel customer experience, let\u2019s look at some examples of successful omnichannel experiences.\n\nApple\u2019s integrated omnichannel experience\n\nApple\u2019s first approach to building a great product is delivering a world-class customer experience. This includes building a seamless digital-physical experience, so customers have the same retail encounter in the US, UK, or anywhere in the world.\n\nWhat they do well:\n\nGreat in-store experience with highly-trained sales specialists armed with their IPads and ready to help. Their expertise makes it easy for customers to build trust in the brand.\n\nEmbrace an omnichannel retail strategy so customers can pre-order a new product online before it launch and reserve it for pick-up at a local store.\n\nRemain consistent and true to the Apple identity: clean, smooth, and techy.\n\nCreate an immersive ecosystem so customers can easily connect their devices or switch to a new one.\n\nWarby Parker\u2019s unique omnichannel retail experience\n\nFinding the right pair of frames for your glasses is a miserable experience, but Warby Parker is changing that experience for users. The company has a unique omnichannel retail experience that allows customers to shop for eyewear both online and in-store.\n\nCustomers can start personalizing their experience by browsing glasses on the website, choosing five frames, and trying on each frame at home with the Home Try-On program for five days. Their in-store experience is optimized to promote social interaction between customers while shopping.\n\nWarby Parker also invests in virtual try-ons with augmented reality (AR) technology and vision testing technology so customers can find glasses that fit, and book prescription check-ups, and eye exams from the app.\n\nMbank personalized omnichannel experience\n\nMbak is a leading digital bank that offers a seamless and personalized omnichannel experience to its customers. Omnichannel means that customers can interact with the bank through multiple channels, such as in-person, social media, or their mobile app.\n\nMbank focuses on personalization. They focus on collecting customer data in one place to track their interactions across all channels. For example, they use data to understand customers\u2019 preferences and behaviors and tailor their products accordingly.\n\nThey also constantly adopt new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, biometrics, and other emerging technologies to offer smart and secure solutions to their customers.\n\nHere are some amazing results they\u2019ve achieved after implementing an omnichannel experience.\n\nEmbrace the power of omnichannel to serve every customer\n\nUltimately, we\u2019re designing experiences for people. It\u2019s almost impossible to do that if we don\u2019t understand their needs, expectations, and where they\u2019re coming from.

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here .\n\nExpert\u2019s Guide to Designing High-Converting Landing Pages\n\nDo you ever wonder what the big secret is behind landing pages that convert? I expect every online marketer does at some point, especially when they first start out.\n\nIf the same question is bugging you, then I\u2019ve got some answers. I\u2019ve also got examples, tools, and tips to help you create high-converting landing pages.\n\nSuccessful landing pages can generate a significant amount of revenue.\n\nHere\u2019s some proof.\n\nConversion Rate Experts generated $1,000,000 million for Moz with a single landing page, an enticing call to action, and a few emails.\n\nWant some more evidence? OK then.\n\nThe Entrepreneur\u2019s Handbook feels that a landing page is a license to print money when you get it right.\n\nAre you inspired by that? Awesome, because this guide gives you everything you need to get started, including:\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nUnderstanding High-Converting Landing Pages\n\nA landing page is a webpage that aims to get visitors to act in a certain way. For instance, signing up for a newsletter, inviting people to a conference or webinar, making an announcement, offering a discount, or making a purchase. Landing pages also help you capture leads.\n\nThese pages are a crucial feature in digital marketing.\n\nMarketers spend tons of time and resources driving traffic to their landing pages, hoping the target audience joins the opt-in process. However, you\u2019re wasting your time if these destinations don\u2019t entice prospective customers into your sales funnel and educate and convert them into customers.\n\nThat\u2019s why you need to focus on creating landing pages that convert. You should first understand that designing a remarkable landing page takes more than slapping on graphics, writing some text, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.\n\nThere\u2019s a craft to it, which I\u2019ll discuss today.\n\nWhat Is a High-Converting Landing Page?\n\nIt\u2019s a common practice among many marketers to create a unique landing page for each campaign.\n\nWhy? Because it facilitates a specific part of the conversion process by allowing users to opt in. However, there are other reasons why you want to focus on creating landing pages.\n\nHere are some of the main benefits that you can gain for your online business by using specific landing pages for your marketing campaigns:\n\nLanding pages aim to enhance conversions. A well-designed landing page can help capture email leads, increasing your chances of converting more leads into sales.\n\nBy segmenting your audience and tailoring your messaging, you can create landing pages that connect with visitors on a deeper level.\n\nLanding pages can help you build your brand by projecting a consistent message and aesthetic that resonates with your target audience.\n\nWith the right optimization strategies, landing pages can improve your SEO and drive more traffic to your site.\n\nBy tracking metrics like bounce rates and conversion rates, you can monitor the effectiveness of your landing pages and make data-driven improvements over time.\n\nThey give a positive first impression. Landing pages can help you appeal to your audience, so they will want to stick around and switch from reader to customer.\n\nWhy You Need a Landing Page\n\nLanding pages allow you to engage visitors and spur them into action: did you know that images, videos, and graphics can attract your visitors and persuade them emotionally to take action?\n\nThat\u2019s because while your blog may highlight popular posts, gather email subscribers, or recommend affiliate products, a landing page has only ONE purpose: to get conversions. Here are some key ways that a well-designed landing page leads to that goal.\n\n1. Promote a Positive First Impression\n\nLanding pages can help you appeal to your audience, so they will want to stick around and switch from reader to customer.\n\nAdditionally, by segmenting your audience and tailoring your messaging, you can create landing pages that connect with visitors on a deeper level.\n\nLanding pages can also help you build your brand by projecting a consistent message and aesthetic that resonates with your target audience.\n\n2. Take Advantage of Trust Elements\n\nYour landing page is your opportunity to start building trust among your consumers. That means a professional design, providing quality content, and addressing prospects\u2019 pain points.\n\nYou can also include videos to give your product life and a voice.\n\nAdditionally, including social proof like reviews, testimonials, and user-generated content from happy customers all inspire trust.\n\n3. Increase the Conversion Rate\n\nLanding pages provide your lead with the information they need to move them further along the customer journey and closer to a conversion.\n\nCalls to action encourage users to take the action you want them to (for instance, sign up for a newsletter or ask for a quote).\n\nIn addition, by tracking metrics like bounce rates and conversion rates, you can monitor the effectiveness of your landing pages and make data-driven improvements over time.\n\nTypes of High-Converting Landing Pages\n\nIf you want to create a high-converting landing page, you have several options:\n\nText-Only Landing Pages\n\nMost online marketers prefer to use copy primarily text-based for their landing pages. They don\u2019t include videos or large graphics, just a couple of images to appeal to the section of your brain that processes visual information. Copyblogger is a typical example. It uses a CTA button instead of a text link.\n\nLong or Short Copy?\n\nShould the landing page copy be long or short? It depends on what you\u2019re trying to achieve.\n\nIt\u2019s common to find long-copy landing pages in the digital marketing industry. It\u2019s a great format when trying to showcase the benefits of your products or service to close a sale.\n\nOn the contrary, keep your copy brief if you want someone\u2019s email address in exchange for your free report. Short copy enhances the user experience, gets more consumers to jump into the opt-in process, and results in getting more subscription forms completed.\n\nI think you should test both types of copy and make your own decision.\n\nHowever, some sources say that longer landing pages convert better. If you\u2019re using a long-form format, ensure you format it correctly.\n\nVideo Landing Pages\n\nAccording to Globe Newswire, online video platform revenue is projected to reach 2.2 billion by 2030 as YouTube, Vimeo, and other video sites become more popular. No matter what your product or service is, adding a short video that walks the prospect/customer through your offer will improve your conversions, as long as the opt-in process is simple.\n\nIn addition, videos can show prospects how your product works, which is a must if it needs to be installed or configured. For example, when you visit Slack, you can watch the video to learn what the messaging software can do for you and how to use it.\n\nThe Benefits of Using Videos on Your Landing Page\n\nWhy use video? Well, if you want to create landing pages that convert, then video could be just what you need. It helps with:\n\n1. Retention: A valuable video inspires people to stay longer on your page, allowing your message to penetrate.\n\n2. Increased trust: Videos give your product life and a voice, increasing trust.\n\n3. Meeting customer preference: Unbounce found that many people prefer to watch a 5-minute video rather than read an article. Your landing page converts better if you give people what they want.\n\n4. Providing a Call To Action: A CTA lets visitors know what you want them to do next and inspires action. Here\u2019s an example from Panorama9.\n\nIn addition, videos can show prospects how your product works, which is a must if it needs to be installed or configured. For example, when you visit Slack, you can watch the video to learn what the messaging software can do for you and how to use it.\n\nHere are a few tips for using video on high-converting landing pages:\n\nKeep your landing page video short and useful, because desktop viewers tend to stick with videos for 30 to 90 seconds.\n\nStart with a great video thumbnail that displays your product or service\u2019s main benefit or value proposition.\n\nUse conversational language to explain the benefits of your offer and how it can help solve your audience\u2019s pain points.\n\nEnsure that the video is high-quality and looks professional. Poor video quality can detract from your message.\n\nInclude a clear, attention-grabbing call-to-action (CTA) at the end of the video to encourage viewers to take action.\n\nConsider adding subtitles or closed captions for viewers who are watching without audio.\n\nUse analytics to track how your video is performing and make adjustments as necessary.\n\nNote: Sometimes, you can have a hybrid landing page, where you use more than one element in the copy. A landing page builder can help you with ideas for this.\n\nExamples of Good and Bad Landing Pages\n\nWho\u2019s getting it right, and who\u2019s getting it wrong when it comes to high-converting landing pages? Here are some examples of the good and the not-so-good.\n\nBad Landing Pages\n\nAAA life insurance: A lot is going on (wrong) here. Most insurance sites offer a free quote with minimal information (mostly just a ZIP code). AAA takes more of a \u201cdemanding\u201d rather than \u201coffering\u201d approach. It asks for excessive amounts of information, which can quickly drive people to your competitors.\n\nChase Bank: Phew! There\u2019s a lot to take in here, the main problem is too many CTAs. On the left, there is an \u201cOpen an Account\u201d CTA button; on the right, another CTA button asks you to sign in. And below this, five links take you to different destinations. Then below those, even more CTA\u2019s encouraging visitors to take different actions.\n\nThis is a perfect example of where a dedicated page would help them cut out unimportant content and focus on what they want to achieve.\n\nGood Examples\n\nUnbounce: There is a brief description of two very important attributes (VIAs) (with links so someone can learn more if they want). At the bottom of the page, there is another visually-distinct CTA in video form for visitors to explore products and benefits.\n\nUber: The rideshare company gets it right for people interested in becoming drivers. It uses concise language that speaks to a common pain point\u2014flexible working. There\u2019s just one highly visible CTA, keeping the design clean and easy to navigate.\n\nFinally, there is a great use of visuals to add interest showing a friendly, relatable person.\n\nStep #1: Conducting Market Research\n\nEvery good landing page starts with market research: gathering vital information about your target market and customers to create value and provide a desirable customer experience.\n\nWithout market research, you don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s an audience for your product and an interest in your topic.\n\nWhere do you start with market research? Here\u2019s some suggestions.\n\nVisit Google Trends\n\nStep #1: Visit Google Trends. Type your keyword into the search box. Click the search icon.\n\nStep #2: Study the trend for the past six months.\n\nThe chart above shows steady demand for \u201cproject manager\u201d as a search term over a six-month period.\n\nThat\u2019s a good starting point for deciding whether to build a landing page focused on this area.\n\nNext, it\u2019s time to find out more about what your prospects want by conducting some market research among your current customers/leads.\n\nUsing surveys or polls on social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter can give you an idea of what topics and products interest them the most. Additionally, analyze the comments section on your blog or social media posts to understand your prospect\u2019s pain points.\n\nHowever, when conducting market research, remember that what prospects SAY may not match what they DO. For example, if you survey your email list to find out their challenges, they may say that they are struggling with traffic generation. Therefore, you\u2019ll want to delve deeper by:\n\nConducting research on your target market. This can include analyzing industry trends, examining customer feedback, and reviewing competitor strategies. You can tailor your messaging and offerings more effectively by getting a better sense of what works in your space.\n\nAnalyze your tracking for user behavior and test different approaches. Use the data to refine your messaging over time and increase conversion rates.\n\nUnderstand the Mindset of a Landing Page Visitor\n\nFinally, to create a high-converting landing page, you have to understand buyers\u2019 mindset. As an online business owner, you have to focus on re-orienting your entire business around your customer\u2019s needs. Your landing page has to make them want what you have to offer. However, that can be a challenge, as Professional Academy shows:\n\nThis infographic shows us the 5-step process consumers go through before and after purchasing a product or service:\n\nStep #1: The recognition of need. The shopper has a specific need and is looking to buy a solution to meet it.\n\nStep #2: Information search: The shopper begins searching to see what products are out there.\n\nStep #3: Evaluation of alternatives: The buyer is still in the decision process. Do they really need the product? Are there alternatives? The customer often looks for reviews, pricing, etc., during this phase.\n\nStep #4: Purchase \u2013 Once the issue of store location and shopping convenience has been addressed, the shopper further considers products with the best deals and quality. If they\u2019re convinced, they will place an order.\n\nStep #5: Post-purchase \u2013 The shopper is concerned with the experience while shopping at a particular store. Were the items shipped on time and in good condition?\n\nYour landing page has to answer some of these questions. A landing page builder can help you develop a clear, concise way to present this if you aren\u2019t confident in doing this yourself.\n\nMarket Research Through Social Media Networks\n\nAnother way to find out more about your customers is via social media. When you monitor your customers on social media, you get to know what they said about your brand and where.\n\nHowever, having a conversation with prospects or customers on social media is a simple way to extract useful data about them, your brand, and your market. It also creates a positive brand and user experience from the start.\n\nSocial media can be overwhelming, so just remember you don\u2019t need to be on every platform. Focus on the ones where your customers are most likely to be. Platforms like Quora are also helpful to conduct market research.\n\nUnderstanding Keyword Intent\n\nTo close your market research, learn how to look beyond a given keyword and understand the intent (purpose) behind it and how that relates to your target audience.\n\nKeyword intent is about finding out what users really want.\n\nUsing Google Keyword Planner, I searched for \u201cab training.\u201d These were the related keywords and their average monthly search volume:\n\nThe first long tail keyword (core workouts at the gym) has far more average monthly searches than \u201cab training\u201d so you can see how valuable keyword research is to give you inspiration for your market research. However, the competition is low, so very few advertisers are bidding for the term.\n\nAs a content writer/blogger, if you write content and include that keyword in the headline, build relevant links to the page, and send some social traffic to it, you may succeed in improving your ranking. However, your conversion rate is likely to remain low without a concise opt-in process.\n\nWhy? It\u2019s because you didn\u2019t optimize for the people who actually want to buy the product.\n\nLet\u2019s see how keyword intent from the results above can help you identify the best product for your landing page:\n\n1. Core exercise: The searcher here is looking for information related to core exercise. Content that shares generalized exercises isn\u2019t as relevant for this consumer, because their focus (intent) is the abs.\n\n2. Core workouts at the gym: Here, it\u2019s obvious that the searcher likely has a gym membership and is looking for specific information to do at that location.\n\n3. Weighted ab workouts: If you have a product in the form of training videos or a step-by-step tutorial, you could easily convert these searchers, because they are looking for specific workouts. However, don\u2019t use hype or tricks in your content. Be honest and provide value to turn the searcher into a customer.\n\nStep #2: Designing Your Landing Page\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll look at the anatomy of a perfect landing page and discuss each element one by one.\n\nAs Unbounce shows, every part of your landing page matters. You can innovate, but don\u2019t leave out anything essential.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of a structure designed to optimize landing page conversions.\n\nKey Elements of High-Converting Landing Pages\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll look at the anatomy of creating a high-converting landing page and discuss each element individually.\n\nHeadline\n\nThe headline is your landing page\u2019s first and most important element. Make it bold, clear, and benefit-driven.\n\nBlogs that write catchy and valuable headlines get the most social media shares. In fact, over 50 percent of social shares come from people who just read the headline!\n\nThat works for landing pages, too. For a high-converting landing page (a lead magnet), your headline must be creative, straight to the point, create urgency, and solve a particular problem. In fact, they have to be magnetic for someone to complete the subscription form.\n\nSupporting Subheadline\n\nNever underestimate the importance of a great subheadline. Top Left Design says that a subheadline gives people a reason to read all our copy instead of skimming or scanning it. Use it every time to give more context to the main headline.\n\nVisual Focus (headshot, video, etc.)\n\nThe brain processes visual information faster than text. That\u2019s why you must add a visual focus to your landing page, such as your headshot, a photo, or a video. Take a look at the example below from Dollar Shave Club, with a video front and center.\n\nCustomer/client testimonials (optional)\n\nYou can also add real customer testimonials to your landing page. Testimonials can boost your sales. However, only use them after you have gotten results for other people. If you\u2019re just starting out, this is optional.\n\nI use clients\u2019 testimonials on my landing page. Testimonials build trust in your personal brand because you show real results for people. It\u2019s part of the positive user experience you are trying to achieve in your landing page builder.\n\nCore Benefits\n\nTo appeal to customers and inspire them to take action, highlight the core benefits of your product/service on your landing page. Derek Halpern, founder of Social Triggers, does this on his home page.\n\nCall-to-action\n\nTo successfully convert visitors to email subscribers or customers, you need a simple, clear, and clickable call-to-action. You could use a link, but call-to-action buttons are common because they grab attention, especially when they are colorful.\n\nLanding Page Design Tools\n\nSeveral tools are available if you need help designing your landing page. Below are some of the top landing page tools:\n\n1. Unbounce: A landing page builder you can use to build, optimize and carry out A/B tests to determine what works and what doesn\u2019t on your landing page.\n\n2. OptimizePress: Easily create landing pages, sales pages, and membership portals.\n\n3. PopUpDomination: One of the best pop-up opt-in box creators around. It works for beginners, intermediates, and online business experts as a landing page template with drag-and-drop ease.\n\n4. OptinMonster: A great exit intent tool that will help you capture emails and leads. It\u2019s a flexible yet very easy-to-use landing page template.\n\n5. Instapage: You can use Instapage to create a single professional landing page, 100% free. However, if you want more landing pages, you\u2019ll have to upgrade to a paid version of this landing page builder.\n\n6. Leadpages: This is popular because you can collect email leads from anywhere without displaying an opt-in form.\n\n7. Getresponse: Use their landing page builder to run a marketing campaign. There\u2019s a free plan available that offers a landing page, website builder, sign-ups, and contact forms.\n\nHigh-Converting Landing Page Design Best Practices\n\nClear User Interface and Experience\n\nFor your landing page to work, ensure the user interface is clear. The focus is on your visitor, not you. You must align every element on your landing page to appeal to the end user.\n\nClean and Legible Fonts\n\nMost consumers shop online using mobile devices, says Pew Internet. This means that you must make your landing page mobile-friendly. You can check how your landing page appears on different mobile devices using MobileTest.me.\n\nSimple and User-Friendly Navigation\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s not advisable to have external navigation on your landing page. However, if that\u2019s what you decide, make sure it\u2019s simple and user-friendly. You can learn from David Risley, founder of Blog Marketing Academy. His landing page looks professional, has a visual focus, a clean design, and is easy to navigate.\n\nThe AIDA Model\n\nOne of the best-known practices in the content marketing world is the A.I.D.A model. A.I.D.A. is an acronym for Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action. A good way to apply this in practice with content creation is through having unique, novel, and captivating graphics to drive attention, holding interest through valuable context, stimulating desire by connecting this to product benefits, then leading to action with a CTA.\n\nStep #3: The Psychology of Colors\n\nThe right colors are integral in creating high-converting landing pages. Color psychology tells us that you\u2019ll feel anxious in a room painted yellow and peaceful in one painted blue. Color psychology works online too, as the Logo Company\u2018s chart on how colors affect buying decisions shows:\n\nHere are some key color areas to think about.\n\nBackground Color\n\nIf your background color is wrong, your page won\u2019t convert as well. When using a solid color on your landing page background, ensure it won\u2019t interfere with the text; if it\u2019s a deep color, make sure that the text contrasts well.\n\nFor example, Mind Tools has a lot on the landing page, but it uses contrasting orange and blue colors that draw your attention to crucial information.\n\nMilani Cosmetics uses a white background and clean design to let the high-quality colorful product images speak for themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, you can adopt a minimalist design for your landing page and just make the background plain white. I\u2019ve had success with white backgrounds, especially on CrazyEgg, and so has Copyblogger Media.\n\nLink Color\n\nI\u2019ll have to agree with Peep Laja, founder of ConversionXL, that \u201cthere is NO best color for increasing conversion.\u201d\n\nLinking from your landing page, especially when you want to accomplish a special goal (capturing email leads), is not a good practice. However, if you want to link, start with the web convention of using blue for underlined links and maroon for followed links.\n\nNote: Feel free to be creative with your landing page. If red links work for you, use them. If green links are getting clicked more, use those.\n\nCall-To-Action Colors\n\nI believe that the color of your CTA can either inspire people to click or discourage them.\n\nIn choosing colors for calls to action, consider what each color represents and how consumers will perceive them.\n\nFor example, the color pink is symbolic of unconditional love. Brands often use this color to target women, as it\u2019s seen as more feminine. Orange radiates warmth and happiness.\n\nShould you still use pink or orange color on your call-to-action if you\u2019re not targeting females and are not in the dating industry? Of course, you should.\n\nBlue is the color of trust and peace. If you sell digital items like ebooks, software, plugins, and themes, blue will most likely help build trust and loyalty among customers.\n\nSeveral online payment merchants use blue for their call-to-action buttons because they want to give end users (customers) peace of mind improving the user experience and increasing consumers jumping into the opt-in process.\n\nBlue works well for Optinmonster, while other brands prefer red. However, remember that every industry and marketing campaign is different; test and measure to find the right ones for you.\n\nFinally, be mindful of mobile users. I can\u2019t tell you how discouraging it is to visit an online store on my tablet only to find that the call-to-action button overlaps with the pricing.\n\nStep #4: Make a Landing Page That C.O.N.V.E.R.T.S.\n\nYou don\u2019t want people just to visit your page. You want them to take action once they are there. Make it as easy and compelling as possible for them by including these elements found in a landing page that CONVERTS:\n\nC = Clear Call to Action\n\nO = Offer\n\nN = Narrow Focus\n\nV = VIA: Very Important Attributes\n\nE = Effective Headline\n\nR = Resolution-Savvy Layout\n\nT = Tidy Visuals\n\nS = Social Proof\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these items in detail.\n\nClear Call To Action\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross has a famous scene where salesmen were being trained to remember ABC: Always Be Closing. This applies to landing pages, too.\n\nYour call to action (CTA) should be the focus. The CTA is what you want visitors to do: Shop Now. Sign Up. Try It. Contact Us. See Our Video.\n\nClearly and temptingly, ask visitors to take the next step in your conversion funnel. Only accentuate one CTA and avoid distracting visitors with other requests.\n\nSome considerations for your CTA design:\n\nEnsure you display your CTA at least once in a visually distinct, centralized, and obviously buttony-looking button. Don\u2019t make people guess what they should click on.\n\nUtilize visual cues like arrows or images of people focused on the CTA button to draw the user\u2019s attention.\n\nExperiment with the color, size, and placement of the button, and try using different types of language for the copy, like a subtle call-to-action (\u2018Support Our Cause\u2019) versus a more direct one (\u2018Donate Now\u2019), to see what resonates best with your audience.\n\nMake it easy and compelling for your visitors to take the desired action by repeating the call-to-action (CTA) at the bottom of the page where content continues after the fold. Here\u2019s a great example from Pocket. The eye goes right to the CTA. Especially nice is the way the video is miniaturized here because the play button on a video can be distracting.\n\nEnsure you emphasize the primary CTA as the most important one on the page, by de-emphasizing any secondary CTAs. The best pages accentuate only one CTA, like this great example from Promo.\n\nOffers\n\nTo motivate visitors, offer something in exchange for what you want them to do. An offer can be a discount, a free trial, a whitepaper, or a matching gift.\n\nThe best offers pull users deeper into the conversion funnel:\n\nA bill pay website might offer users $10 for the first bill they pay, which would require them to sign up for the service and connect their accounts.\n\nA consulting agency might offer a free 60-minute consultation, which really is a meeting to describe how awesome the agency is.\n\nWhatever you offer, try pairing it with a deadline to create a sense of urgency and spur a response. Make sure you keep the offer simple and that it doesn\u2019t distract from the CTA. United gets it right with its \u201cExplore\u201d page.\n\nCredit cards almost always include an offer \u2013 no surprise, given the direct mail experience these companies have. Note that the offer requires the cardholder to spend over a certain dollar amount before qualifying for the air mile bonus. For instance, you need to spend $1,000 in the first three months to get 20,000 bonus air miles. Good visual cues draw the eye to the CTA, too.\n\nNarrow Focus\n\nNumerous studies show the more choices you offer people, the longer they take to make a decision. The clearer and simpler you make your page, the more likely you are to get someone to take the action you want.\n\nTo increase the chances of visitors taking the desired action, simplify your landing page by removing unnecessary links and content.\n\nMinimize the navigation bar\n\nMove non-essential information to the \u201cAbout\u201d section\n\nKeep forms short\n\nFocus on the CTA and place additional links below the fold\n\nHome pages should also follow these principles because they are often the first landing page visitors see.\n\nHere\u2019s a cautionary tale from Oracle:\n\nHow many things are there for you to click on the landing page? 48. That\u2019s 48 opportunities for whoever visits the page to wander off.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect example of where using a dedicated page would help Oracle cut out unimportant content and focus on what they want to achieve.\n\nSalesforce gets it spot on, though.\n\nIt\u2019s by no means the prettiest landing page. But for enterprise software, it is admirably restrained. There\u2019s no navigation bar up top, it tucks away any administrative links at the bottom, and social links are small and discreetly grayed out.\n\nIn addition, the form asks for just a few fields, and even tells you how many fields there are. It finishes with a nice, bright, benefit-offering CTA. Perfect!\n\nVIA: Very Important Attributes\n\nWhen creating a website, don\u2019t assume visitors will automatically sign up without any information about the product or service. Instead, showcase the Very Important Attributes (VIA) that appeal to visitors. Identify two to five key features and highlight them on the front page rather than overwhelming visitors with a long list.\n\nIn general, you can describe your VIA as:\n\nFeatures \u2013 a list of cool things about your product or service\n\nBenefits \u2013 how the features will help your visitor\n\nPain points \u2013 how the features will help your visitor avoid misery\n\nTry different approaches to see what works with your audience. It\u2019s important to test which attributes you highlight, how many you show, and how you describe them. Remember to make sure your list of attributes doesn\u2019t distract from your CTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for inspiration, Unbounce is a great example. (below the fold). There is a quick description of two VIA (with links so someone can learn more if they want). At the top right of the page, following the natural eye line, there is another visually-distinct CTA for those who are ready to try out a free trial.\n\nEffective Headline\n\nCopy written for print or display ads often features a clever, funny, or outrageous headline. It has to because those ads are trying to wave their arms in your face and distract you from whatever else you were doing.\n\nOn your webpage, though, you aren\u2019t fighting for attention. You\u2019ve already done something to funnel your visitors there. Now you just need to convince them to pull up their chairs and stay awhile.\n\nPeople coming to your site are going to decide in a split second if they want to go back to their game of \u201cWords with Friends\u201d or stay and see what you are all about. A key way to keep them is to tell them in plain language what your site is all about.\n\nFor example:\n\nSelling a blanket with sleeves? \u201cHome of the Slanket, the famous blanket with sleeves.\u201d\n\nSelling a marketing consultancy? \u201cHow to market better.\u201d\n\nSelling the latest location app? \u201cFind your friends instantly.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how not to do it from SAP.\n\nBetween the vague headline and information overload from too many options stuffed full of jargon (a trap most enterprise software has a hard time resisting), you come away not really knowing what SAP does, or its benefits.\n\nCloudera is doing it right.\n\nAt a glance, you can see what this company does: it\u2019s a platform for big data. The CTA directs users to find out more in a video or info link. It also uses video, clean design, visuals, and simple navigation.\n\nResolution-Savvy Layout\n\nDo you know that there are people out there still surfing the web on 800 x 600 monitors? And that the most popular screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 worldwide?\n\nThat means the overall visual picture you see on your big HD monitor might differ significantly from what your customer sees. Keep the essential parts of your message\u2014logo, headline, call to action, a supporting visual\u2014in the center top of the screen, with supporting messaging lower down on the page.\n\nMake sure your designer knows which are the most important elements on your page and puts them front and center.\n\nIf you can adjust your display, check the layout of your page at different resolutions, including non-standard screen sizes, to enable even people with older monitors to see your headline and CTA without scrolling. You should check it on mobile and tablets, too.\n\nHere\u2019s a cautionary tale on what to avoid.\n\nCheck out Alaska\u2019s official state website on a mobile platform. We\u2019ve got lots of scrolling to do to get to service information, links that look like Google ads, and images that aren\u2019t optimized for mobile. Overall the layout does not provide a good user experience.\n\nOn a positive note, we\u2019ve got the visual Website Optimizer at 1024. Ah, it\u2019s all there. Good headline, bright CTA, social proof, and some VIA. Even on a smaller screen, the most important elements are visible.\n\nTidy Visuals\n\nIf you have spent more than 30 minutes on the Internet, you likely have seen one of those ads with a GIF of a rotting banana with the headline \u201cLose 50 lbs with this one weird trick.\u201d\n\nAvoid distracting elements on your website that may sidetrack visitors from the main message. While they might be effective for catching attention in ads or headlines, using these elements on your landing page can appear gimmicky and unprofessional. Good design incorporates the following elements:\n\nA clean, simple design with plenty of white space keeps people trained on your call to action.\n\nBig font makes it easy and compelling for them to read and understand what your site is all about.\n\nBullets make big blocks of copy easy to scan.\n\nVideos pack a huge impact into a small space and can increase conversions by 80 percent.\n\nImages and graphics relevant to your product and related to your audience support your message instead of diverting attention.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at an example of getting it right from Wix, who nail clean design with a clear CTA here. The use of color here draws your eye to the call to action. Navigation items are muted. The design is clean and simple, and key product benefits are succinctly explained without jargon or too much text.\n\nSocial Proof\n\nI once had a summer job at a nonprofit where I collected money door-to-door. One day I got on a bit of a roll and signed up several people in the same neighborhood. After a while, I didn\u2019t even need to go into my pitch; I just held up my sheet, showed people that all their neighbors had donated, and they ponied right up.\n\nAs social creatures, humans tend to place greater value on things that other people have already approved. That is why most sites tend to display evidence of such social validation, like:\n\nA list of customers\n\nPress mentions\n\nUsage statistics\n\nTestimonials\n\nIf you are just starting, you probably don\u2019t have much of this. But even one or two quotes from beta users, alpha users\u2014heck, your mom\u2014can show site visitors that someone else has derived value from you offer.\n\nHere\u2019s a good example from Optimizely. It includes four pieces of social proof on one screen. These are all from leading global brands touting the benefits Optimizely with real case examples and the visually uncluttered presentation of notable logos to create an instant impression of trust and authority.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are high-converting landing pages?

The best cheap web hosting service for most people is Hostinger or DreamHost.\n\nCheap web hosting is an excellent option for brand new websites. You don\u2019t need to spend a fortune on top-tier hosting when you\u2019re just getting started. Cheap hosting will get the job done.\n\nBut you can\u2019t just look at the price alone. The key is finding a great deal from a reputable hosting provider, so your site\u2019s quality, speed, and performance don\u2019t suffer.\n\nThis in-depth guide covers my top picks of the best cheap web hosting plans. I\u2019ll also show you how to narrow down the best option for your website.\n\n#1 \u2013 Hostinger Review \u2014 The Best Web Hosting Plan Under $2\n\nHostinger has the absolute cheapest price for hosting at $1.99 per month for the Single Shared Hosting plan. So what\u2019s the catch?\n\nYou have to sign up for a 48-month contract, which sounds a little heavy. But, bear with me.\n\nFour years of Single Shared is going to cost less than a single year of hosting through most other providers.\n\nSeriously, other low-budget hosting plans are still twice to four times as expensive. Plus, the introductory rates you get with competitors might skyrocket when you have to renew. Once the honeymoon period is over, you might be looking at $10 or more each month.\n\nWith Hostinger on the other hand, your rate for shared hosting goes from $1.99 to just $3.99/month upon renewal. That\u2019s still a great price.\n\nIn other words, the Hostinger full rate is still less than introductory rates from other good cheap hosting options.\n\nOkay, great. But I know you\u2019re thinking the low rate must mean that there are annoying domain limits and few free tools to build your business.\n\nUntrue. Hostinger is loaded to the brim with features and function.\n\nHostinger\u2019s Single Shared Hosting plan supports one site, and includes:\n\n100 GB bandwidth\n\n30 GB storage\n\n1 email account\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\n99.9% uptime guarantee\n\n24/7/365 customer support\n\nOptimized for WordPress with one-click installation\n\nUser-friendly control panel\n\nCloudflare protected nameservers\n\nThere\u2019s no free domain name included, which isn\u2019t a big deal if you already have one. Bluehost and DreamHost come with a free domain name for the first year, but higher per-month rates.\n\nIf you need a free domain name, more storage, or unlimited bandwidth, Hostinger lets you upgrade your plan while keeping costs low:\n\nSay you need to move to Premium Shared Hosting to support another site. That will cost $3.49/month to start and $6.99/month when you renew. That\u2019s not going to break the bank, and you can host up to 100 websites.\n\nHostinger does a lot to ensure that the service is easy to use. Set up takes minutes and absolutely zero technical skill.\n\nIf you ever have issues, Hostinger\u2019s customer service is always available and has a phenomenal reputation. The company gets you in the door with budget-friendly prices, and keeps you around with quality support.\n\nChoose Hostinger for the lowest per-month plan on the market. Try it today risk-free, as Hostinger will refund your purchase if you aren\u2019t happy within the first 30 days.\n\n#2 \u2013 DreamHost Review \u2014 The Lowest Spend on Day One\n\nNot everyone wants to sign a long contract for hosting, but you usually have to in order to get the lowest price. That usually also means dropping $75, $100, or more at checkout.\n\nDreamHost offers good deals for one- or three-year terms, but their month-to-month pricing cannot be beat.\n\nIt\u2019s seriously the lowest monthly rate you\u2019ll see.\n\nDreamHost Shared Starter is only $1.99/month for one site. No contract necessary.\n\nThere\u2019s really no way to get a lower price without a commitment.\n\nWhen you look at the month-to-month pricing for other plans on this list, there is no competition. A2 Hosting is $10.99/month, HostGator is $10.95/month, and Hostinger is $9.99 with a $4.99 setup fee.\n\nBluehost and iPage don\u2019t even offer plans without at least a year-long commitment.\n\nWith DreamHost, you can still get cheap hosting, but you don\u2019t have any of the long-term risk that comes with a multi-year contract.\n\nThis can be really important if you\u2019re running a cash-strapped startup betting on growth. Instead of a big upfront spend, you can budget a predictable monthly hosting cost into the equation.\n\nNot only that, but you also get a solid range of features and free tools to build your site:\n\nUnlimited traffic\n\n50 GB storage\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nFree WordPress website builder\n\nFree automated WordPress migrations\n\nAutomated WordPress updates\n\n24/7 live chat and ticket support\n\nLike Bluehost, DreamHost is officially recommended by WordPress. The integration is deep and all of the updates are handled automatically. This is good for security purposes and saves you the trouble of doing it yourself.\n\nSo you can get all the benefits of tight WordPress integration without the commitment and large down payment required by Bluehost.\n\nNow you might think that no contract would mean no money-back guarantee. The truth is DreamHost has a zero-risk 97-day money-back guarantee.

But, with UltaHost, you\u2019re getting high-quality support and bullet-proof security features from day one\u2014even when all you\u2019re looking for is entry-level shared hosting.\n\nEvery UltaHost plan comes with 24/7/365 live chat support. So, whether you need help in the middle of the night or have an emergency on a holiday, UltaHost can assist you right away.\n\nIf you\u2019re switching from another hosting provider\u2014like one that only amplifies your headache when you\u2019re looking for help\u2014you can take advantage of UltaHost\u2019s free migration services for pain-free site transfers.\n\nHere\u2019s another bonus\u2014even UltaHost\u2019s cheapest hosting plans come with free daily backups. You won\u2019t have to upgrade to a higher tier or pay for a third-party backup plugin to keep your data safe.\n\nSpeaking of safety, UltaHost uses enterprise-grade DDoS protection to protect your website against malware, spyware, viruses, redirects, and more, all in real time.\n\nIn addition to UltaHost\u2019s robust security technology, you\u2019ll also benefit from automatic updates. All of your plugins and instances will be updated to the latest version and patched to protect against the latest exploits.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. UltaHost\u2019s team proactively monitors your servers 24/7. If they detect any problems, they\u2019ll fix them before you even know the issue exists.\n\nIn the web hosting industry, this level of support and service is more common for higher quality hosting tiers like fully managed VPS hosting. It\u2019s rare to see them offered with entry-level shared hosting, as UltaHost does.\n\nIn terms of price, UltaHost isn\u2019t the cheapest provider on my list. But, for just an extra $1 per month compared to the rock-bottom rates on the market, UltaHost is well worth the price if you prioritize security and customer service.\n\nPlans start at $3.29 per month for new customers. Unlike other hosting providers that jack up rates to triple or quadruple the promotional price, UltaHost\u2019s entry-level shared hosting plan renews at a very reasonable price of $4.39.\n\nBeyond the security features mentioned above and the always-available support, this plan also includes:\n\nUnlimited bandwidth\n\nA free SSL certificate\n\ncPanel\n\nGuaranteed 99.9% uptime rate\n\nSSD and NVMe storage\n\nOverall, UltaHost is affordable, secure, and fast hosting, with all plans backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can sign up with UltaHost risk-free, knowing that you can cancel without consequences if you\u2019re unhappy for any reason.\n\n#4 \u2013 Bluehost Review \u2014 The Best for New Sites (Especially WordPress)\n\nThere\u2019s probably no easier way to get your new website off the ground than with Bluehost. And it won\u2019t cost you much at all, as the company offers incredibly feature-rich shared hosting starting at $2.95/month.\n\nFor most people with a new site\u2014especially if it is their first site\u2014Bluehost is what they want.\n\nIf you are building a WordPress site, I really recommend checking out your options at Bluehost. The company is one of only three hosting providers that is officially recommended by WordPress. The integration is amazing and installation is automatic.\n\nWe\u2019ll talk more about why it\u2019s so good for WordPress in a second, but I want to talk about why it\u2019s good for just about anyone with a new site.\n\nFirst off, Bluehost has some of the cheapest hosting rates around. And even the most basic plans are loaded with features and value.\n\nYou get a free domain name for the first year. Not only do you get to skip that expense, but the convenience of registering your domain through Bluehost cuts down on the time it takes to go live.\n\nIf this is your first site ever, you will be grateful at how simple the process is. If you\u2019ve built sites before, you will really appreciate everything that\u2019s done for you.\n\nFor example, you get a free SSL certificate for your site,and enabling it takes one click on the dashboard. This is critical for keeping all of the information on your site secure and lets visitors know that the site is safe to visit.\n\nYou can get free SSL certificates from other places, but they will not be this easy to install, trust me. And you will have to renew them every couple months.\n\nWith Bluehost, it\u2019s completely hands-off and you are always protected.\n\nYou also get a free content delivery network (CDN) through Bluehost\u2019s partnership with Cloudflare. This is going to improve site speed and performance with near-zero work on your part.\n\nOkay, so on top of the free domain name, SSL certificate, and CDN, Bluehost gives you:\n\n50 GB storage\n\nUnmetered bandwidth\n\n24/7 customer support via phone and live chat\n\n$100 Google Ads credits\n\nAutomatic WordPress installations and updates\n\nCustom WordPress themes\n\n30-day full refund if you aren\u2019t satisfied\n\nAll of these features are included with the Bluehost Basic shared hosting, which starts at $2.95 per month. If you have to upgrade, prices stay affordable at the higher tiers.\n\nYou can even go for the second-most powerful package, Choice Plus, for the same price as the Plus package. Bot offer unlimited websites and storage, but Choice Plus comes with domain privacy included and one year of free automated backups.\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that Bluehost renewal rates are about two to three times higher than the introductory rate. This is why I recommend signing up for a long plan to max out the discount period.\n\nEven at full price, though, Bluehost is really competitively priced compared to the field. This is especially true when you consider the long list of features you get and the ease of getting set up.\n\nIt\u2019s as hands-free of a hosting experience as you could ask for and when you want to develop your site, all the tools are right there.\n\nWordPress is automatically installed on Bluehost, for example. This means full integration and automatic WordPress updates.\n\nWith Bluehost shared hosting, you can use another content management system (CMS) besides WordPress if you want.\n\nBut if you know that you are only going to use WordPress, I highly recommend going with one of Bluehost\u2019s WordPress Shared Hosting plans.\n\nThese start at $2.95/month, which is the same price as regular shared hosting. The difference is that the servers that have been optimized exclusively for WordPress. There\u2019s no other type of software on them, so servers can be better configured and more easily protected.\n\nIf you have a new site in mind, make Bluehost your one-stop-shop for getting online. Get everything set up in a single place instead of having to go through a domain registrar. Best of all, you\u2019ll get a great deal in the process.\n\nSo if you have a new site: Get Bluehost Basic shared hosting.\n\nAnd if that new site is a WordPress site: Get Bluehost Basic WordPress hosting.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that more than 2 million sites are hosted through Bluehost. Find out why today.\n\n#5 \u2013 A2 Hosting Review \u2014 The Best Web Hosting Under $3 for Online Stores\n\nIf you grow your ecommerce site past a certain point, the cheapest web hosting options won\u2019t work. But, if you are just getting your online store up and running, there is no better budget-friendly option than A2 Hosting.\n\nIn fact, you can get everything you need to launch for $2.99/month with the A2 Startup plan. You\u2019ll have to sign a contract to get the lowest rate, but you\u2019ll be ready to go within minutes.\n\nAlong with PayPal integration, the cheapest A2 hosting plan comes with one-click installs for five of the top ecommerce platforms, including WooCommerce, OpenCart, and Magneto. There\u2019s hardly any backend IT work to start selling.\n\nA2 Hosting offers some of the best site speed and security for the price, which are really important for online stores.\n\nShoppers won\u2019t stay if your content is slow to load. A2 takes care of all the technical legwork that goes into maintaining high performance servers. It\u2019s compatible with Cloudflare\u2019s free content delivery network, which can boost your speed as well.\n\nMost shoppers won\u2019t even come if Google says your site\u2019s not safe. That\u2019s going to happen if you don\u2019t have an SSL certificate. A2 includes one for free, and it\u2019s always enabled.\n\nThis is a huge perk, because you can get free SSL certificates elsewhere, but it\u2019s on you to configure and renew them, which can be frustrating.\n\nMost of the other security benefits are similarly hands off. The virus scanner, firewall, and brute force defense are on autopilot\u2014you\u2019ll receive notification if there\u2019s something you need to do, but A2 handles a lot on its own.\n\nAnd if you have an issue you can\u2019t solve, A2 will help. Go read reviews. The company has some of the happiest web hosting customers on the planet. If you need to move your old site to A2\u2019s servers, they have a team that will do it for free.\n\nSome of the other excellent benefits of A2 Startup include:\n\n100 GB storage\n\nUnlimited bandwidth\n\nUnlimited email addresses\n\n24/7/365 customer support via phone, live chat, email, and ticketing\n\n99.9% uptime commitment\n\nOptimized WordPress hosting\n\nDNS management tools\n\nWebsite staging\n\nWebsite staging is really useful for online stores. You can test new features and buttons on a page in a development area before pushing it live. This way you can see if anything breaks before it impacts your customers.\n\nThe A2 Startup plan is aptly named\u2014it won\u2019t be enough once your site matures. But by the time you\u2019ve hit that milestone, your site will be bringing in more than enough money to justify the cost of upgrading.\n\nI like A2 Hosting for online stores because of the speed, security, and generous limits on storage. 100 GB is twice as much as you get with Bluehost.\n\nAnd if you aren\u2019t happy with your service, A2 Hosting will refund your account within 30 days of purchase. It\u2019s a true hassle-free money-back guarantee.\n\nYour online reputation matters, so it\u2019s a huge peace of mind to know that customer service is always there. A2 Hosting representatives are extremely knowledgeable. They will help you resolve issues quickly, before your online store takes a hit.\n\nSign up with A2 Hosting today for the cheapest possible way to host your online store.\n\n#6 \u2013 HostGator Review \u2014 The Best Way to Host Your Existing Site for Cheaper\n\nWhen your current host jacks up the rates or takes a customer service nose-dive, you need to switch. Whatever the cause, there is no reason to pay for substandard hosting.\n\nHostGator will help you migrate your old site for free. This includes the cPanel, email accounts, files, databases, scripts, etc. They also include one free domain registration transfer, which saves a few bucks, too.\n\nAll you have to do is fill out a transfer form within 30 days of signing up. HostGator will do the rest.\n\nYou get the free migration with any of HostGator\u2019s shared hosting plans, including Hatchling, which starts at $2.75/month with a three-year contract.\n\nWith HostGator, you can lock in a really low rate and get great uptime for less than you paid before. After the zero-stress migration, you get high quality customer support available any time of day by phone and live chat.\n\nBetter still, they offer some of the best renewal rates in all of web hosting. If you lock in that Hatchling plan for three years when you first sign up, you can renew for another three years at just $6.95 per month. That\u2019s a good two to three bucks cheaper than other providers.\n\nIt\u2019s cheaper web hosting, better service, and very few limits on what you can do. And if they can handle the job of hosting your website for the long haul, you can save a boatload of money over the duration.\n\nSome of the highlights include:\n\nUnlimited storage\n\nUnlimited bandwidth\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nFree email\n\nFree domain (or registration transfer)\n\nOne-click WordPress install\n\nFree website builder\n\nFree Google Ads and Bing Ads credits\n\nThe good news is that HostGator provides tons of tools to help you optimize the content on your site and keep things running at top speed. The interface is very easy to use, which gives you complete control over your site and databases.\n\nIt\u2019s comparable to Bluehost in a lot of ways, which I like better if you have a brand new site.\n\nBut if you already have a website, Bluehost won\u2019t move it over for free. HostGator will. If you have more than one site to migrate, HostGator will give you a quote for the cost, but the first one is free.\n\nThis makes your transition to cheaper hosting a lot easier. Plus, HostGator offers a 45-day money-back guarantee. If you don\u2019t like what you see, you have more than a month to jump ship without paying a cent.\n\nQuit spending too much on hosting and find out why so many people love HostGator.\n\n#7 \u2013 iPage Go Review \u2014 The Best If You Have Multiple Sites\n\niPage Go lets you create unlimited websites for under $2/month. Every other plan on my list requires you to purchase an upgraded plan to support more than one site.\n\nI really like iPage Go because there is one plan. Without tiered pricing, you don\u2019t have to worry about upgrading your plan until you need something more substantial than shared hosting.\n\nIn other words, you can build as many websites as you want without having to stress about paying more to do more.\n\nWith iPage Go it\u2019s unlimited sites, domains, and storage. Like similar \u201cunlimited\u201d offerings, your service has no hard and fast limits, but there are restrictions on how much your site can demand from the shared server.\n\nSo, when iPage says they offer scalable bandwidth, it means they aren\u2019t metering the traffic to your site. You could still hit restrictions, but there is no set cap for the number site visitors.\n\nMost people looking for cheap hosting for their websites won\u2019t have to worry too much about these limits. iPage is able to support 99.5% of customers without any issues at all. In fact, the company will work with you to make sure you\u2019ve optimized your site if you start to approach restricted usage limits.\n\nIn addition to providing the cheapest multi-site hosting option, iPage gives customers access to a ton of free tools to build and nurture their site.\n\nYou get a free domain name for the first year, along with a free SSL certificate. On top of that, you get free email with autoresponders. You can use the email provided, or manage your website accounts with Microsoft Outlook and other third-party apps.\n\niPage hosting includes a free website builder, which can help you customize the look and feel of all your sites. WordPress is a one click installation as are other popular content management systems like Joomla and Drupal.\n\nFor less than $2 per month, all of this is yours. Other benefits include:\n\n24/7 customer service\n\nUnlimited databases\n\nOne-click installs for OpenCart, Magneto, and PrestaShop\n\nPayPal integration\n\nIntegration with popular email marketing software services\n\nSite traffic reporting\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\nThere is no month-to-month pricing for iPage Go. You can sign up for one, two, or three years. The longer the contract you sign, the lower the introductory pricing and renewal rate you get:\n\nI\u2019m not aware of another hosting provider who gives you a discount on your renewal rate for signing a long contract, so that is a unique perk.\n\nAs I mentioned, you\u2019ll never have to upgrade to a different shared hosting plan. You get everything they offer with iPage Go. There are hardly any limits on your resources, and if your site gets too popular to be supported by shared hosting, iPage has some more powerful hosting solutions at competitive prices.\n\nUntil then, host all of your websites for one low price with iPage.\n\n#8 \u2013 GreenGeeks Review \u2014 The Best Price for Managed WooCommerce Hosting\n\nTransforming a basic WordPress website to an online store can feel like a daunting task for many people. Deploying the free WooCommerce plugin is a simple solution, but you still need adequate web hosting to accommodate your newly enhanced ecommerce store.\n\nGreenGeeks handles all of this for you.\n\nThey offer fully managed WooCommerce hosting with one-click installations. You\u2019ll also benefit from managed perks like automatic updates and daily backups\u2014even with entry-level plans.\n\nStarting at $2.95 per month, GreenGeeks offers an exceptional value for managed WooCommerce web hosting. Just be aware that you need to lock in a three-year contract to get the lowest possible rate in the Lite tier.\n\nThis could cause some slight hesitation for users who don\u2019t want that type of commitment. Fortunately, GreenGeeks\u2019 prices don\u2019t jump as drastically for short-term contracts\u2014which can\u2019t be said for other web hosting providers.\n\nFor example, the Lite plan increases by just $1 per month if you go with a two-year contract instead of three. And it\u2019s still offered at the low rate of $4.95 per month for annual plans.\n\nRemember, this is for fully-managed WooCommerce hosting. So it\u2019s still a great value. Additionally, you will be locking in your extremely low price for the full three-year length of the contract. You don\u2019t have to worry about unforeseen price hikes until well into the future.\n\nYou\u2019re also getting unmetered data, 50 GB of space, a free Wildcard SSL, and a free domain for one year.\n\nWhen you need a bit more power and features, the Pro tier carries a great price point of just $4.95 per month for the three-year term. It gives you an unlimited number of websites versus the one website in the Lite tier, as well as unlimited web space.\n\nWith the Premium tier, which starts at $8.95 per month, GreenGeeks will guarantee that you receive the highest level of site performance. This is an ideal tier for operating an online store.\n\nGreenGeeks is also built to scale. So if your website grows over time, you can easily upgrade to a Pro or Premium plan for more resources and enhanced benefits.\n\nBest of all, GreenGeeks is known for offering some of the best-in-class customer support in the world of web hosting.\n\nYou can reach them by phone, email, or live chat. The call center is available seven days per week, and the average email response time is just 20 minutes.\n\nGet started with GreenGeeks today to get a great deal on WooCommerce web hosting.\n\nWhat I Looked at to Find the Best Cheap Web Hosting\n\nYou\u2019re looking for the cheapest plan out there, but you still need a dependable host.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of budget-friendly web hosting options available. Each one promises great uptime, site performance, and customer support.\n\nIt seems like anyone can get their site up for less than the cost of a cup of coffee.\n\nWhat\u2019s the catch?\n\nIf you understand your options and pick the right one, there is no catch.\n\nI\u2019m going to guide you through saving every dollar possible without getting scammed or locked into a plan that you\u2019ll regret later.\n\nUse these four criteria to cut through the advertising gimmicks, rule out plans that are \u201ctoo good to be true,\u201d and hone in on the best deal for lowest price.\n\nPrice\n\nOne of the key criteria in finding the best web hosting is price. For me, it\u2019s the most important criteria\n\nI always ask myself: How can I get dependable hosting at the absolute lowest price?\n\nWhen you\u2019re paying for hosting each month, even a few dollars\u2019 difference between plans adds up over time.\n\nHowever, you have to be careful when looking at price \u2013 you have to look at it alongside reputation.\n\nI focused my attention on web hosts with a rock solid reputation because their cheap hosting options don\u2019t cut corners. These plans are undoubtedly no-frills hosting, but I made sure they cover all the essentials.\n\nIf you go with one of the cheap hosts that don\u2019t have the strong reputation, you can get a rock-bottom price but also a rock-bottom experience.\n\nThe providers I chose have super-affordable plans that won\u2019t cause trouble now, won\u2019t trap you into upgrading, and won\u2019t wind up costing a fortune down the road.\n\nContract Terms\n\nLots of web hosts might seem cheap at first glance, but you need to review the contract terms to truly get a sense of the actual cost.\n\nTo lock in the lowest possible rate, you\u2019ll likely have to commit to a two, three, or even a four-year plan.\n\nImportantly, these contracts are typically paid up-front and in-full.\n\nThat means that web hosting advertised at $3 per month could actually cost you upwards of $100 today.\n\nAlong with the length of the contract, you need to check the renewal rates. It\u2019s common practice in the web hosting industry for hosting plans to skyrocket upon renewal.\n\nPromotional pricing might cost $3 per month, but then automatically renew at something like $10 per month.\n\nThat would more than triple your rate upon renewal. Suddenly it\u2019s not so cheap anymore.\n\nDomain Limits\n\nHow many sites do you want?\n\nIf you add a site or two, you could accidentally get forced to upgrade and pay a lot more.\n\niPage, for example, lets people create as many websites as they want with their cheapest hosting plan.\n\nWith Hostinger, on the other hand, you\u2019ll have to upgrade to host more than one site. That said, Hostinger\u2019s next plan up is still less than $3 per month and you can build up to 100 websites.\n\nAnother important limit to consider is bandwidth. This is the maximum amount of data your site can transfer to users during a set amount of time.\n\nNow there\u2019s no such thing as unlimited bandwidth, but you are definitely going to see that advertised with a lot of the cheapest web hosting plans out there.\n\nWhy can they say this?\n\nBecause these are shared hosting plans where your site is on a server with a bunch of other sites. On a typical day, these sites are not going to use all of the server\u2019s resources, so they say it\u2019s unlimited.\n\nThe truth is that you will definitely still have limits on how much of the server\u2019s central processing unit (CPU) your site can use.\n\nGetting too many visitors to your site may exceed your CPU limits, and the provider may ask you to upgrade.\n\nShared hosting plans with unlimited bandwidth are perfect for cheap web hosting, just don\u2019t equate it with unlimited visitors.\n\nFree Tools to Build and Grow Your Site\n\nYou\u2019d be surprised, but even some of the least expensive web hosting plans are packed with free tools and capabilities. Getting these freebies as part of a bundle can help you save in other areas.\n\nSome of the features to look out for include:\n\nAd credits : free Google or Bing advertising credits to target your audience\n\n: free Google or Bing advertising credits to target your audience Domain name : your site\u2019s online address at www.your-domain-name.com\n\n: your site\u2019s online address at www.your-domain-name.com Email account : an address @your-domain-name.com\n\n: an address @your-domain-name.com SSL Certificates : protects online privacy and lets visitors know your site is secure\n\n: protects online privacy and lets visitors know your site is secure Visual website builder: an application that lets even total newbies design beautiful pages\n\nEverything that\u2019s included with your hosting plan is something you don\u2019t have to spend more money on.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to register your domain name, but if your hosting plan includes it, that\u2019s going to save you $10-15 in the first year.\n\nGetting a free professional email is another $30 in your pocket. The freebies add up.\n\nEven Hostinger, which can be purchased for less than $1/month, comes with an email account, SSL certificate, and a website builder that requires zero coding knowledge to use.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend very much to get your site online, but if you aren\u2019t careful, web hosting can wind up costing a lot more than you think.\n\nChoosing a reputable provider is the first step, but you don\u2019t have to worry about that if you stick to my list of best cheap web hosts. These are all really well-known companies with a long history of dependable service.\n\nHostinger \u2014 Best web hosting plan under $2 DreamHost \u2014 Lowest spend on day one UltaHost \u2013 Best for support and security Bluehost \u2014 Best for new sites (especially WordPress) A2 Hosting \u2014Best web hosting under $3 for online stores HostGator \u2014 Best way to host your existing site for cheaper iPage Go \u2014 Best if you have multiple sites GreenGeeks \u2014 Best price for managed WooCommerce hosting\n\nMy top recommendation is to go with Hostinger. At less than two bucks per month at the outset and a better renewal rate than anyone else, you can rest assured you\u2019re getting the best deal with them.\n\nOf course, if you don\u2019t want to lock into a long contract to get low rates with Hostinger, I recommend DreamHost. You can get high-quality hosting for less than $5/month without any commitment.\n\nIf you have a new site in mind and you want to get it off the ground quickly, Bluehost is the choice for you. It\u2019s a little pricier than Hostinger, but still under $3/month. Plus Bluehost includes a free domain name for the first year (you\u2019re going to need that for a new site), which saves another $10-15 right there.\n\nIf you have multiple sites to host, iPage should be your first and last stop. Unlimited websites for less than $2/month. Say no more.\n\nShortlist A2 Hosting for online stores. It\u2019s well set up to handle the extra security and performance demands of ecommerce. If you\u2019re running a web store on WooCommerce, think about GreenGeeks for a little extra savings for comparable performance.\n\nAnd if you are tired of your current hosting situation, let HostGator help. They will migrate your site to their servers for free. Then you can start saving money and enjoying quality customer service again.\n\nSee How My Agency Can Drive More Traffic to Your Website SEO - unlock more SEO traffic.

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here .\n\nBest Reseller Hosting\n\nDisclosure: This content is reader-supported, which means if you click on some of our links that we may earn a commission.\n\nReseller hosting can be extremely lucrative\u2013and not just for traditional resellers.\n\nWhether it\u2019s an add-on to your existing business, a side hustle, or the start of a standalone hosting company, there are plenty of ways to turn a profit in this space. And, with white labeling, you\u2019ll be able to sell these services with your own branding.\n\nWeb designers and developers can use reseller hosting to create a source of recurring revenue. Instead of building a site and getting paid once, they can take care of their clients\u2019 hosting and get paid every month.\n\nReseller hosting is also a good option for companies that need multiple cPanels. This can be way more cost-effective and easier to manage than purchasing multiple hosting accounts the old-fashioned way.\n\nHere are my top picks for reseller hosting companies. After the in-depth reviews, you\u2019ll find a short buyer\u2019s guide to help you home in on the right one for you.\n\n#1 \u2013 HostGator Review \u2014 The Best for Hosting Clients with Basic Sites\n\nHostGator is a great pick for resellers that host small businesses and other organizations that don\u2019t have super complex websites. You can easily provide hosting for these clients and take advantage of HostGator\u2019s competitive pricing.\n\nThe reason I recommend HostGator for people that are hosting smaller sites is that you\u2019ll max out the server resources too quickly if you\u2019re hosting something with too much traffic. A big ecommerce site, according to HostGator, is probably better suited on a VPS or dedicated server. HostGator offers those types of hosting, but not for resellers.\n\nYou also don\u2019t have as much control over the server with HostGator reseller hosting. Of course, if your clients don\u2019t need anything fancy, you won\u2019t have to tinker with the backend at all.\n\nReally, HostGator takes care of most of the IT legwork, leaving you an uncluttered management interface that lets you accomplish things in a few clicks. You can monitor your sites, customize your cPanel branding, and manage all your users in WHM.\n\nSo that\u2019s the tradeoff\u2013a little bit less control for you, but a lot less work because HostGator handles so much of the day-to-day maintenance.\n\nOne thing to consider is keeping the easy clients to host yourself and sending the labor and resource-intensive clients to HostGator. You can set up an affiliate deal with them and earn up to $125 per signup.\n\nEven if you only refer a few people successfully, it would cover a year\u2019s worth of your hosting costs. You\u2019ll be making money off the trickier clients without having to absorb a whole new set of IT headaches.\n\nHostGator includes an array of helpful features to make your job as a reseller easier and more lucrative:\n\nDomain reselling\n\nMerchant gateways\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nFree WHMCS\n\nPrivate name servers\n\nSpam protection\n\nCourtesy weekly backups\n\nThis last point, the free weekly backups, is really helpful. It\u2019s not a full-scale disaster recovery failsafe, but it\u2019s a zero-effort insurance policy that protects you and your clients if someone makes a mistake.\n\nA lot of the time, backups are completely on you. It\u2019s just one more way HostGator makes your job as a reseller so much easier.\n\nThere are five HostGator reseller hosting plans available. The first three are pictured below:\n\nThe Aluminum plan is aimed at people who are just getting into the reselling game and priced accordingly. For $19.95 per month, you are looking at 60 GB of storage and 600 GB of bandwidth. This is very generous considering the price.\n\nWhat\u2019s even better is that WHMCS is included free, no matter what plan you pick. You\u2019ll find that it\u2019s often an add-on cost with similarly low-priced plans. HostGator includes it at no cost.\n\nIf you need to upgrade from Aluminum or need more resources, HostGator\u2019s plans stay affordable. So long as you aren\u2019t trying to host sites with millions of visitors, you can scale up to get the resources you need.\n\nThe price is going to increase upon renewal. This is par for the course with hosting, but you should be aware of it.\n\nPlaying the low-maintenance reseller game can be really rewarding. Not every business needs a high-octane website, but they still need great hosting.\n\nHostGator has a 99.99% uptime guarantee. In fact, should you get anything less, HostGator will actually credit you a full month of service. It\u2019s a real guarantee, not just something the company says.\n\nAnd should your clients run into another type of issue that you can\u2019t solve yourself, HostGator customer support is always available via live chat, phone, or submitting a ticket.\n\nYou can try HostGator free for more than a month. The company has a 45-day refund policy if you aren\u2019t happy.\n\n#2 \u2013 InMotion Review \u2014 The Cheapest Reseller Hosting That Doesn\u2019t Cut Corners\n\nInMotion offers great prices for resellers with hosting packages that include everything you need.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a gimmick price. You\u2019re not spending anything extra to brand your sites or bill your clients. Even if you go with the cheapest plan they offer, you get WHMCS, WHM, and 25 cPanel accounts.\n\nYou might also think its low-cost plans would mean InMotion is stingy on the resources, but the opposite is true.\n\nThe entry-level plan, which is $15.39 per month, comes with 80 GB of storage, 800 GB of bandwidth, unlimited email accounts, and one dedicated IP. That\u2019s a boatload more than you get from other providers at that price.\n\nBecause it\u2019s shared hosting, InMotion takes care of all the backend server maintenance and the essential security services. Your only responsibility is to take care of your clients.\n\nPeople who aren\u2019t tech wizards will find managing InMotion\u2019s reseller platform very easy. Experienced resellers will appreciate how much has been streamlined. You can choose from pre-configured hosting packages and start selling immediately.\n\nIt includes Softaculous, which lets you install more than 400 apps with one click. This includes BoldGrid, a WordPress website builder owned by InMotion. That means your clients can install both and get to work designing their site with nearly zero effort.\n\nInMotion\u2019s reseller plans are ready to go out of the box. You are getting the full range of services you need to start hosting your clients, such as:\n\nUnlimited email\n\nFree SSL certificate\n\nMalware and hack protection\n\nFree white labeling\n\n24/7/365 customer support\n\nFree domain reseller account\n\nCustom name servers\n\nIt\u2019s the complete package at a great price. I\u2019ve already talked a little bit about InMotion\u2019s cheapest possible plan (R-1000S), but the price remains very affordable if you need to upgrade.\n\nTo get the best possible price, you\u2019ll have to sign up for two years. I doubt committing will be much of a problem for people who are seriously considering reseller hosting\u2014it\u2019s not a get-rich-quick scheme. And, by choosing InMotion, you can lock in that ultra-low rate for two full years.\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s a promotion which offers the second tier plan (R-2000S) for the same price as the entry-level plan. This is an exceptional deal, giving you more than a TB of bandwidth and 120 GB storage to resell for under $16 per month.\n\nThe renewal prices will be more expensive, which is normal, and why I recommend locking the discount in for as long as possible.\n\nShould you ever outgrow your ability to use shared hosting plans, the company offers several reseller VPS hosting options. By the time you need to upgrade, you\u2019ll be more than experienced enough to manage a VPS and InMotion will always be there if you have any questions.\n\nFor people that are novices in reselling or want to take their business to the next level, it makes sense to look at InMotion\u2019s Reseller Advantage plan. It\u2019s a one-time $250 cost that completely sets you up with a custom pre-built website to start selling hosting and domains.\n\nChoose from three storefront options and customize from there. InMotion\u2019s staff will help you configure the backend so that your management and billing is automated correctly.\n\nI think Reseller Advantage is worth it if you don\u2019t want to spend the time getting everything set up yourself.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s an added cost. And it\u2019s not 100% necessary\u2014even for first-timers\u2014because InMotion provides the tools, resources, and quality customer service to get you off the ground.\n\nIf you are looking to spend as little as possible on reseller hosting, InMotion won\u2019t let you down. You\u2019re getting all of the critical tools and features for one low price.\n\nTry InMotion reseller hosting today. If you sign up for more than six months, you will get a 90-day money-back guarantee. That\u2019s three months risk-free.\n\n#3 \u2013 A2 Hosting Review \u2014 The Fastest Shared Servers a Reseller Can Get\n\nYou can really make money as a reseller when you\u2019re able to offer your clients hosting that\u2019s a cut above the standard.\n\nThat\u2019s what you get with A2 Hosting.\n\nThe company is constantly upgrading their server technology to the latest and greatest, passing the benefits off to their clients. If you go with them for reseller hosting, you get to provide that high-speed performance to your own clients.\n\nIt\u2019s still shared hosting, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014you\u2019re going to get more firepower from a VPS or dedicated hosting plan. But with A2, you get best-in-class speed without the significant increase in cost or IT responsibilities. Those other types of hosting are great, but you have to know exactly what you\u2019re doing in order to keep things fast and secure.\n\nA2 maintains everything, and you can get servers with NVMe storage as opposed to SSD. Without getting too deep in the tech talk, NVMe storage is more efficient for your CPU and has read/write speeds that are three times faster than SSD storage.\n\nEvery other host I looked at offers SSD, which is a huge step up from older HDD storage. But, just as SSD has replaced HDD, NVMe is like the way of the future. A2 gives it to you today.\n\nAnd you get to pass on that technological edge to your customers.\n\nYou can also take advantage of Lightspeed web servers that offer up to 11 times faster performance compared to Apache and six times faster than NGINX.\n\nOn top of that, Anycast DNS duplicates your records across A2\u2019s global network, which decreases latency.\n\nIn plain English, all of that means that visitors to your clients\u2019 sites will experience much faster loading and response times.\n\nNone of this is marketing lingo. A2 has made concrete upgrades to its hardware and network that translate into better performance.\n\nAlong with top technology, A2 provides you with some of the best customer service in hosting. People adore A2\u2019s techs and support staff. If there is ever a problem, you can get help quickly any time of day.\n\nThe staff will also assist you with moving your sites from your old host to A2. In fact, migrations are free for up to 25 cPanel accounts of 30 GB or less.\n\nMost of the heavy lifting for security is handled by A2. You want to ensure that your clients aren\u2019t using 1234 for their password, but virus scanning, server hardening, brute force protection, and firewalls are all handled by A2. In addition, you\u2019ll get:\n\n99.9% uptime commitment\n\nCustom domain name servers\n\nCloudflare CDN\n\nOne-click installs for WordPress, WooCommerce, and other apps\n\nFree domain name reseller account\n\nFree server rewind backups\n\nI really like the server rewind backups, which automatically take snapshots of your data and store them safely. If there\u2019s ever an issue\u2014say one of your clients accidentally deletes a critical file\u2014A2 makes it easy to recover and restore.\n\nThis is not the cheapest reseller hosting plan you can get, but it\u2019s a cut above many of the other shared hosting options you\u2019ll find. That said, the price is still extremely competitive.\n\nA2\u2019s hosting plans are broken down into regular and Turbo packages. To get the high-performance server hardware I\u2019ve been talking up (like NVMe and Lightspeed web servers), you have to go with one of the Turbo plans.\n\nI highly recommend going with the Turbo plans. Yes, it\u2019s more expensive\u2014but it\u2019s also what sets A2 apart from other hosts. If you are trying to offer your clients the best technology, Turbo is the way to go.\n\nOne thing to note is that WHMCS and the ability to white label is an extra cost with Kickstart plans. A2 does give you Blesta for free, which will let you handle all your billing, but if you want to use your own branding, it is an add-on fee based on how many clients you have.\n\nI recommend A2 for resellers who want to position themselves as offering top technology to their clients. You may be able to charge more, which offsets the slightly increased cost of going with A2. And because of the company\u2019s renowned customer support, you\u2019ll be able to offer your clients a stable experience 24/7.\n\nGet in touch with A2 today and start hosting your clients on the fastest shared servers available.\n\n#4 \u2013 Liquid Web Review \u2014 The Best for Hosting High-Traffic Clients\n\nLiquid Web is great for completely supporting tons of sites or clients with large resource needs. Think ecommerce and membership sites with a lot of traffic. Really anything that\u2019s going to consume a lot of hosting resources and requires more control at the server level.\n\nEven if you only have a few clients with high-traffic sites, they can\u2019t afford to mess around. Liquid Web will give you what you need to make sure they never run into trouble.\n\nPlus you get a bigger price break the more you resell. On the low end, you get a 5% discount, and if your 12-month revenue total is $48,000+, you can get a 20% discount on the wholesale rate you pay for hosting.\n\nYou can handle whatever your clients throw at you. And the more they spend, the greater your savings and profit because of Liquid Web\u2019s reseller hosting program pricing.\n\nLiquid Web doesn\u2019t offer shared hosting, which is why I really only recommend them if you have high-traffic sites that can\u2019t live on a shared server. But other than that, you\u2019re not constrained in any way. Choose VPS, cloud, or dedicated hosting.\n\nFor as high-powered as these hosting options are, Liquid Web gives you great pricing.\n\nDedicated reseller hosting, for example, starts at $99 per month, which is phenomenal. Usually dedicated servers are thousands of dollars per month. This can be a really good option if you have clients with compliance concerns (e.g. HIPAA) or with unusual hardware/software requirements.\n\nYou may be aware that using VPS, cloud, or dedicated hosting comes with a lot more IT responsibilities on your end. That\u2019s still true, but to a much lesser extent than with other vendors.\n\nThat\u2019s because Liquid Web provides managed hosting solutions, taking over much of the server monitoring, security, and performance optimization.\n\nIn that sense, you get the server power and control of premium hosting options without all the stress.\n\nYou\u2019re also getting the complete toolkit to manage your clients in whatever environment you choose.\n\nWHMCS comes free with every plan, and if you are using one of the cloud hosting options for your clients, you\u2019ll have Liquid Web\u2019s upgraded version of WHMCS. This makes it easier to handle common reseller responsibilities for cloud hosting, like customizing instance sizes or creating a client area so they can manage tasks themselves.\n\nAny client you want to support, Liquid Web has you covered. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the various plans:\n\nVPS Hosting : starting at $25 per month\n\n: starting at $25 per month Private VPS Parent Hosting : starting at $149 per month\n\n: starting at $149 per month Cloud Sites Hosting: starting at $160 per month\n\nVPS hosting is an affordable way to ensure that your clients with high-octane sites have their own protected slice of resources.\n\nIf you start to max out what you can do with VPS, you can use Liquid Web\u2019s Private VPS Parent plans. This is essentially like running your own data center, giving you complete control over how you parcel out resources to your various clients. You can go with standard performance (starting at $149) or high performance (starting at $579).\n\nCloud Sites is a great option if you\u2019re managing clients that have fluctuating needs. Maybe they run fire sales on their online store and traffic spikes exponentially from time to time. Liquid Web handles all the server management so you don\u2019t have to. Your clients get a super resilient site without any headaches on your end.\n\nYou can choose from any of those plans, which can be combined with WHMCS for easy reselling.\n\nAlternatively, you can get your own dedicated hosting through Liquid Web. These plans are only available for approved resellers, so you\u2019ll have to get in touch with Liquid Web in order to set these up.\n\nThese plans are unbelievably flexible and priced extremely well. For less than $100 you can start offering your clients dedicated hosting solutions with Liquid Web\u2019s Bronze plan. That\u2019s amazing.\n\nAnd if you need more memory or storage, upgrading is extremely reasonable. The Gold plan ($259 per month) comes with 64 GB RAM, 4 x 480 GB SSD storage, and a 1 TB backup drive. Your WHMCS license is included free, regardless of the plan you pick.\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of the dedicated reseller hosting plans, but Liquid Web gives you enough options to find something that fits your budget. Whether you have one client with a high-traffic site or hundreds, Liquid Web will help you deliver top performance 24/7.\n\nIf your clients are expecting big things from you, there is no better host to have in your corner. In most cases, the company will migrate your sites for free. Get in touch with Liquid Web and get the hosting your clients deserve.\n\n#5 \u2013 HostPapa Review \u2014 The Best If You\u2019re New To Reseller Hosting\n\nAlong with a reputation for great speed and uptime, HostPapa is known for excellent customer service.\n\nIf you are new to the reselling game or hosting in general, this is going to be a really worthwhile option to check out. Maybe reselling is a small side hustle you want to grow or maybe you\u2019re just interested in trying it out.\n\nNo partner is going to offer you the same level of support\u2014along with all the tools you need to put forward your own branded reselling platform.\n\nFor starters, you get a 30-minute one-on-one coaching session when you sign up. This is going to be a major time-saver for people who aren\u2019t 100% familiar with the fundamentals of hosting. It\u2019s a great time to ask questions about your tricky clients or just learn the ropes from an expert.\n\nYou could try and YouTube your way to victory the first time, which could work. But you might end up with confused or irate clients while you\u2019re searching for the answer.\n\nHostPapa is always there to help if you have a question. Get in touch via chat, email, or phone. And, if you already have clients set up with a host you don\u2019t like, HostPapa will move up to 50 cPanel accounts to their servers for you for free.\n\nAnother reason I like HostPapa for beginners is that most of the security responsibilities are off your plate. You\u2019re not fiddling with firewalls, network monitoring, or defending the server from brute force attacks. HostPapa handles all of that and more.\n\nYou worry about your clients. Let HostPapa worry about the backend.On top of all this, HostPapa includes:\n\n99.9% uptime guarantee\n\n400+ one-click install applications\n\nFree SSL certificates\n\nWhite label branding control\n\nCustom nameservers\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\nFree CDN\n\nHostPapa pricing is very competitive within the reseller hosting space, even if it\u2019s a little higher than some of my other top recommendations.\n\nThe prices you see for a 12-month term. You may be able to get a discount by signing up longer, or you can pay a little more to get a six, three, or monthly term.\n\nSomething rare and incredible about HostPapa is that the renewal rates don\u2019t jump up. This is very unusual, so take the \u201chigher\u201d price with a grain of salt. It may actually be lower after the first year, depending on how another host\u2019s introductory pricing is set up.\n\nOne thing to note is that you only get a free billing system (Client Exec or WHMCS) with Gold plans and higher. This is kind of annoying for people just starting out, as a WHMCS license is usually about $20 per month. That\u2019s the only downside, and knowing that may just put Gold into your price range.\n\nPeople who want more than HostPapa\u2019s standard level of support (which is very good) can add on PapaCare+.\n\nThis puts you at the front of the line for service requests, which means you can answer your client\u2019s red alert issues faster. Host Papa will also take over maintenance, like updating plugins, and offer recommendations about how to increase your loading speed.\n\nFor people that are new to the reseller hosting game, HostPapa is an excellent choice. You\u2019re going to get customer service that is a cut above the others, and there is more support available if you need it.\n\nTry HostPapa risk-free for 30 days.\n\n#6 \u2013 ResellerClub Review \u2014 The Best Windows Reseller Hosting\n\nResellerClub has helped thousands of people kick off or expand their reselling business. It\u2019s an established company with a vibrant community of users that help one another to help their clients.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my top recommendations overall, but when it comes to Windows hosting, ResellerClub is a clear winner. You\u2019ll get affordable pricing, free Plesk control panels, and the latest infrastructure to support Microsoft applications.\n\nWith Parallels Panel, you and your clients will be able to install more than 300 applications and scripts in a single click. Does someone need WordPress or Drupal to build their site? It\u2019s one click away.\n\nYou also get free email through ResellerClub. If your clients are already paying for Outlook, great\u2014but if not, you can offer them free email at no cost to you.\n\nManaging your clients is easy with OrderBox, which handles billing, orders, and tracking customers. There\u2019s also integration with WHMCS for free with all but the entry-level plan.\n\nIf you want to use WHMCS instead of OrderBox (which makes sense if you are already using it) I\u2019d just upgrade because it\u2019s only a few dollars more. That\u2019s way less than purchasing a WHMCS license which is an extra $18.95 per month.\n\nAnother unique feature of ResellerClub is the mobile app, which works for Android and iOS. You can buy domains, add customers, manage billing, and contact your account manager instantly.\n\nBecause resellers help clients in different time zones and countries, having a mobile app is really nice. You can\u2019t always be in front of your computer, and ResellerClub lets you handle a lot of the basic and time-sensitive issues from your phone.\n\nResellerClub customer support is always available,and the company offers free migrations to get your sites set up on their servers with as little hassle as possible. Some of the other features include:\n\nSupport for MSSQL and ASP.NET framework\n\n24/7 support via chat, email, phone, tickets, and social media\n\nFree SuperSite storefront\n\n30-day money-back guarantee\n\nFree domain reseller account\n\nFree Cloudflare CDN\n\nWhen you are looking at Windows hosting, you shouldn\u2019t compare prices to Linux hosting (i.e. all the other options I looked at). Windows hosting is always going to be a little more expensive, but if you need it, Linux hosting is not going to work.\n\nThat said, ResellerClub offers some of the best pricing on Windows hosting you can get.\n\nThe entry-level plan, R1, comes with 10 GB storage and 200 GB bandwidth for $17.99 per month. You\u2019ll have to sign on to a three-year deal to get the lowest price, but that is really good for Windows hosting.\n\nOne thing I really like about ResellerClub is that the pricing differences aren\u2019t that steep if you only want to sign up for a year. R1, for example, is only $1 more for a one-year commitment and paying month-to-month is only $2 more.\n\nThis gives you a lot of flexibility. You\u2019re not going to have to put down thousands of dollars on day one to get a good price.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re taking on your first Windows hosting client. With ResellerClub, you can afford to do it without making a significant down payment.\n\nIf you are searching for an affordable Linux host, ResellerClub can also be a good option. The starting price is exactly the same as Windows hosting, though there is an increase upon renewal.\n\nBut if you are a reseller in the market for Windows hosting, I definitely recommend checking out Reseller Club. Get in touch today, and start hosting risk free for 30 days.\n\nWhat I Looked at to Find the Best Reseller Hosting\n\nI only looked at hosts that have the fundamentals locked down.\n\nIf you pick from my list of recommendations, you won\u2019t have to think much about page load speeds and uptime. These are well-known hosts who use the latest technology in order to provide fast sites that don\u2019t go down.\n\nSecurity is another factor that weighs heavy on people\u2019s minds. And it should. However, you won\u2019t have to worry if you stick to my top picks. You\u2019ll find that every host I recommended takes security extremely seriously and provides tools to help you harden your site.\n\nShould we talk about price now? Obviously this is really important if you are trying to turn a profit.\n\nThere\u2019s some really basic math you\u2019re going to want to do in order to figure out which host is going to give you the best deal on the volume of reselling you plan on doing.\n\nBut working backwards from the sticker price is only going to get you so far. There\u2019s still a number of important criteria to evaluate as you\u2019re shopping around.\n\nUse the factors below to help you compare your different options before making a final decision.\n\nWho Are Your Clients and What Are They Hosting?\n\nThe more detailed an answer you can give for this question, the better. You\u2019ll be able to narrow down your selection to a handful of plans that make sense.\n\nEach client you host is going to take up a slice of the server resources you\u2019re buying from the hosting company. The more clients you have, the more resources you need.\n\nYou also want to think about what each client is hosting. Do they have static sites without a lot of interactive elements? Or are these clients with deep database needs and high-traffic online stores?\n\nThe most affordable reseller plans are set up as shared web hosting. This means you share resources with other tenants on the same server. You don\u2019t have to worry about security or managing the server\u2013the host takes care of that\u2013but performance is a little less predictable. Other sites on your shared server may impact your clients\u2019 sites.\n\nHosting a few dozen basic sites with shared reseller hosting isn\u2019t going to be an issue. Simply pick a shared hosting plan that gives you a resource limit that makes sense.\n\nBut if you have a ton of clients, or they have resource-intensive websites, you could run into issues with a shared reseller hosting plan really quickly.\n\nIf your clients need more server power, I recommend going with a provider that offers different types of reseller hosting, like VPS (virtual private server), dedicated, or cloud hosting.\n\nAlong with vastly more resources, these types of hosting give you more control over the servers. This means more IT responsibilities on your end, but it may be necessary if you have to configure the server environment on behalf of your clients. You won\u2019t be able to do this at all with shared hosting, which is configured by your host.\n\nVPS hosting can be a good idea if you have hit your limits with shared hosting. You\u2019ll get a ton more resources and you won\u2019t be sharing them with other sites. If your clients are running online stores or other resource-intensive sites, I\u2019d recommend at least VPS hosting.\n\nDedicated hosting can get really expensive (unless you resell through Liquid Web) because you get a whole server to yourself. This is ideal if your clients have really high-traffic websites, compliance requirements, or special hardware and software needs.\n\nCloud hosting is extremely reliable because it\u2019s spread out in data centers rather than on a single server. It\u2019s a great choice if your clients\u2019 sites have fluctuating needs. You\u2019ll be able to scale resources instantaneously, weathering any traffic spike without a hit to performance.\n\nOnce you know the type of hosting that will support your clients, the next step is picking a plan with an appropriate amount of resources. Here\u2019s a screenshot of HostPapa\u2019s pricing that shows exactly what you get at each pricing tier:\n\nIf you already have hosting, you should be able to check your resource usage in order to calculate what you are going to need. How much storage and bandwidth is going to cut it?\n\nIf you are unsure, reach out to a host that you think makes sense. The sales team will help you forecast your needs and choose an appropriate plan.\n\nIt\u2019s Easy to Manage Clients and Get Paid\n\nAs a reseller, your clients may be scattered all over the world, connected to you by no more than an email. This is why I only looked at reseller hosting options that came with an easy way for you to manage all of your clients and make sure they pay on time.\n\nEach one comes with Web Host Manager (WHM) or software that does the same thing. I really like WHM because it\u2019s easy to use even if you are just starting out. It centralizes the management of all of your clients. You\u2019ll be able to create new cPanels for clients, view their resource usage, and upgrade/downgrade them if need be.\n\nWHM also lets you design hosting packages to market for sale. Choose exactly how many resources clients get with each tier and price accordingly.\n\nIt\u2019s basically an administrative tool, however, and you need something in addition to WHM to handle the billing.\n\nThe most popular solution out there is WHMCS, which stands for Web Host Manager Complete Solution. It basically automates all of the billing for WHM, which is going to save you tons of time. Collecting from clients just happens on its own. You won\u2019t be chasing people down.\n\nWhat you need to look out for is whether or not WHMCS (or something similar, like Client Exec or Blesta) is included with your reseller hosting plan.\n\nThis is especially true if you are looking at the entry-level and affordable plans. If WHMCS isn\u2019t included, it may be an add on cost that makes a seemingly cheaper platform less enticing.\n\nIf you are already a reseller and you are using an automated billing solution, I\u2019d highly recommend only looking at new hosts that offer the same one. Moving your clients from WHMCS to another billing system is going to be more fragmented than importing your data to the same system.\n\nBranding Your Hosting Packages\n\nAs you search the different reseller hosting plans, ask yourself which one is going to let you market your services the way you want.\n\nIs branding important to you? If it is, you need to find a reseller host that white labels their services. This means they remove their brand and let you add yours.\n\nOtherwise, you are positioning yourself as a middleman, simply contracting services on behalf of your clients. For some people, this is fine. It doesn\u2019t matter. But some people really want to have their own brand visibility and look like the web host themselves.\n\nA lot of the providers I picked offer white labeling with every plan they offer, but some only include it with premium plans. So if you are trying to look like the host and not a contractor, some of the really affordable plans may not work out.\n\nBranding is deeper than just slapping your logo on someone else\u2019s software. If you use WHM, I highly suggest taking advantage of the ability to customize notifications for your clients. Instead of a generic message that may be hard for your client to understand, you can create an on-brand notification with the ideal contact linked right there.\n\nYou also want to think about the big picture. Are you positioning yourself as a one-stop shop where clients can get all of their hosting needs taken care of?\n\nIf yes, I\u2019d look for an option that allows you to resell domains along with hosting. Providers like ResellerClub, A2 Hosting, and InMotion give you a free domain reseller account. Having this ability means you can offer more to your clients and set up another stream of recurring revenue.\n\nReally think about the total package you are offering. Which of the reseller hosting options you are looking at allows you to make the most compelling offer to potential clients?\n\nIf you need to white-label your services, budget that in or find a host that includes it free. And if you think there is potential revenue in offering domain reselling, I wouldn\u2019t leave it on the table.\n\nCustomer Service That Makes You Look Good\n\nAs a reseller, your clients are going to come to you with questions and problems with their site. By and large, your host is not going to help your clients directly\u2013that\u2019s your responsibility.\n\nYou\u2019ll definitely be more successful if you can handle a lot of the basics yourself, but there are things you won\u2019t be able to do without help from your host. How quickly can they help?\n\nYou don\u2019t want to get trapped between clients with problems and a host that\u2019s slow to respond.\n\nThe best way to assess the quality of customer service is to sign up and see what happens. With the exception of Liquid Web, every other host offers at least a one month money-back guarantee. So you can test out the quality of their customer service risk-free.\n\nIf the service isn\u2019t great when you first start, it\u2019s probably not going to get better.\n\nSubmit a bunch of tickets and see how quickly the host responds. Are you waiting a few minutes on a chat reply or is it a long time? And what is the quality of the response?\n\nIn my opinion, resellers need more than just answers. Bonus points for customer service that teaches you how to fix things yourself rather than providing canned answers or links to the knowledge base.\n\nThe more you can do on your own, the faster your response time for clients. You are the first line of customer service, after all.\n\nIs your host communicative about scheduled downtime? Servers require maintenance and eventually retirement. A good host is going to make sure you know when sites will be down, ideally at times where it won\u2019t matter much.\n\nThis is a big deal. If you get blindsided by downtime, you are about to get as many calls as you have clients. It\u2019s not a fun position to be in.\n\nSome hosts offer free migration services. This can be a huge value, especially if you are transferring a lot of client accounts to a new host. A bungled migration causes countless problems for months.\n\nCompanies like A2 and HostPapa have expert teams dedicated to carrying out migrations. These professionals can make the transition smooth and flawless.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery website on the Internet must have a web hosting service, and there\u2019s no shortage of potential prospects for resellers in the hosting space. But having success as a reseller starts with choosing the right program.\n\nWhich one is the best?\n\nThe top six options I reviewed are a great place to start your search.\n\nHostGator \u2014 Best for hosting clients with basic sites InMotion \u2014 Cheapest reseller hosting that doesn\u2019t cut corners A2 Hosting \u2014 The fastest shared servers a reseller can get Liquid Web \u2014 Best for hosting high-traffic clients HostPapa \u2014 Best if you\u2019re new to reseller hosting ResellerClub \u2014 Best Windows reseller hosting\n\nWhether you\u2019re a beginner, an experienced reseller, or somewhere in between, you can find what you need with the recommendations listed in this guide.\n\nSee How My Agency Can Drive More Traffic to Your Website SEO - unlock more SEO traffic.

It can sometimes be a long, arduous battle.\n\nTo make the battle easier to win, below are 30 sure-fire tips to get more online sales without spending a ton.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into how to make your first sale online.\n\n1. Send Free Samples to Influencers\n\nYou don\u2019t need to look far to find influential bloggers, journalists, entrepreneurs, and vloggers from various industries and niches. You just need to find the right ones.\n\nSearching social media platforms for influencers and building relationships with them is one way to get started. Using influencer \u201cmatchmaker\u201d services like TRIBE is another.\n\nSending a free sample of your product to influencers who are active in your industry or related to it in some way gives you an opportunity to let them know you appreciate their work with a small gift. Hopefully, you will get a mention on one of their sites or platforms.\n\nThis can result in a spike in traffic and social media followers, but you\u2019ll also have a seal of approval from industry experts. And that can make all the difference when you\u2019re looking for your first sale. If you want to learn more about engaging influencers then read my definitive guide to influencer targeting, which tells you everything you need to know about getting your brand under relevant, important noses.\n\n2. Reduce the Number of Product Choices\n\nDecision fatigue is a thing. Too many choices, too much analysis required, and less purchases are made. (Yes, in that order.)\n\nSo, how to make your first online sale? Reduce the number of products you sell. Here are four ways you can achieve this:\n\nPrioritize your best-selling products. Funnel visitors to your best-performing products. Similar to how you\u2019d \u2018funnel\u2019 visitors to your best-converting pages or blog posts when trying to increase conversions.\n\nGroup your products in order to not overwhelm people. That might apply to category (or even subcategory pages). If possible, one page, one goal. Helix is one of my favorite examples. Their Shop page condenses multiple mattresses down into a \u2018single\u2019 product.\n\nThen from there, you go into a customization builder to select, add, or remove different attributes. The result is a simplified, streamlined, approach. You only have one or two decisions to make on each section at a time.\n\nSegment your traffic to tailor what customers see. Show users what they\u2019d be most interested in. Based on previous visits or purchases. That\u2019s what Amazon does right on their homepage:\n\n3. Visually Streamline How People Choose Products\n\nJust because you have three digits worth of products sitting on shelves somewhere (undoubtedly collecting dust) doesn\u2019t mean you have to haphazardly force all those things onto the same page.\n\nInstead, group your products to avoid overwhelming people. That might apply to category (or even subcategory pages). If possible, you want to keep it to one page, one goal.\n\nThat can even apply to the entire conversion funnel on your site.\n\nHelix is one of my favorite examples. It sells mattresses. Not exactly unique or different. Boring, right? So, what\u2019s so special about Helix? Well, for one, its clean website design makes choosing the right mattress a breeze.\n\nIt condenses multiple mattresses into different categories and price points to narrow your choice.\n\nFrom there, you can click on Core Collection, which takes you to another list of choices like \u201cside sleeper\u201d or \u201cmedium feel.\u201d This narrows down your choices considerably (and quickly).\n\nThe result: a simplified, streamlined experience.\n\n4. Prioritize Product Presentation\n\nSometimes you can\u2019t (or don\u2019t want to) eliminate products from a page. So reducing the number of choices is out.\n\nBut you can still use a few tricks in order to prioritize products. That would give people a visual hierarchy of what\u2019s most important through a series of images, shapes, text, etc.\n\nStart by using size to prioritize products. Here\u2019s a good example from the Dollar Shave Club:\n\nFirst, they\u2019ve reduced the number of options. That much is true. But then they also have used product sizing to help you prioritize which one to go with.\n\nNext use videos or gifs to catch your customers\u2019 eyes. Check out this Bonobos example to see how motion catches your eye:\n\nOr try using contrasting colors. For example, the first image of the three below has the least amount of reviews. But it catches your eye because of the different background image.\n\n5. Offer a Promotion or Discount\n\nConsumers love to feel as if they\u2019re getting value, which is why this approach works well. When you offer a promotion or discount, you give prospects the ideal incentive to sign up for your email list.\n\nIf your lead is browsing, a pop-up box offering a small discount can be enough to get them part with their email details. From there, you can nurture your subscriber through the customer journey, sending them promotions and educational materials based on their search data.\n\nIn fact, one company used a simple discount pop-up to generate more than 600,000 views and more than 40,000 email sign-ups.\n\n6. Start Blogging\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already running a blog associated with your store or product, then you\u2019re missing out on the limitless potential of content marketing.\n\nBy producing free, valuable content, you create trust in your brand and keep people informed. Blogging also gives you scope to share on social media and helps you rank in search engines.\n\nTo get started, consider starting-point queries people have about your products and industry. Then, use your blog to answer these questions as individual articles. My tools AnswerThePublic and Ubersuggest can help you come up with ideas.\n\nFor example, visitors to the Shopify blog might be interested in learning about e-commerce and drop shipping. To meet that need, Shopify might create content that ranks for terms like \u201chow to sell online\u201d and \u201chow to drop ship.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, you can use your blog to offer tips, tutorials, and resources related to your products and the lifestyle around your products.\n\nIf you can create epic content on a regular basis, you\u2019ll begin to see the power of content marketing via social media shares, search engines, and so forth. All of this is covered in my guide to content marketing.\n\n7. Build an Email List\n\nBuilding up an email list is absolutely essential if you want customers to make repeat purchases\u2014and it can help you to make your first sales, too. Best of all, it doesn\u2019t have to cost you a thing.\n\nAccording to Litmus, email has an average ROI of $36 per $1 spent\u2014not too shabby. Building your email list doesn\u2019t cost much, either.\n\nHaving a list of emails from previous and potential customers means you can get your information, products, and content into their inboxes. In contrast, updates made to your Facebook page and Twitter handle will almost never reach your entire following, due to time zone differences and social media algorithms.\n\nStart building your email list by including an email subscription form on your website.\n\nHere\u2019s a clever way to convince visitors to sign up for your list. Instead of simply saying \u201cJoin our Newsletter,\u201d offer an incentive or some type of value for signing up. Skinny Teatox offers the chance to win a free product every week, so they showcase that offering to encourage people to join.\n\nIf you need some more advice on how to get started, read my beginner\u2019s guide to email marketing.\n\n8. Sponsor an (In-Person or Virtual) Event\n\nSponsoring an event can work wonders for your online sales\u2014if you use the right approach.\n\nFirst, ensure you select the right event to sponsor. Search for events where attendees are likely to be interested in your product, and then find out how many consumers will be in attendance.\n\nThen start sorting them by cost.\n\nAvoid sending a convoy of marketers to set up a table and hand out flyers. If there are potential customers attending, you\u2019ll need to be more creative to build relationships.\n\nDemonstrate some of your most interesting products to tell your story, get people talking, and provide on-the-spot rewards like coupons and free stickers in return for email list subscriptions and social media follows.\n\nHere\u2019s how I recommend you measure the ROI of these kinds of events.\n\n9. Interview Industry Influencers\n\nRemember how I mentioned the importance of content marketing earlier? Well, interviewing an industry influencer is an excellent way to create epic content.\n\nInterviews work because they are win-win situations. The interviewee gets more exposure, while the interviewer gets their hands on some hot content for their publication or blog.\n\nMake the most of these interviews by asking relevant questions about their lives and careers and the industry as a whole. This gives fans of the influencers get a taste of their personalities, while others will value their expert advice.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from Eric Siu, author of Leveling Up, who recently interviewed my business partner Hiten Shah.\n\n10. Pull a PR Stunt\n\nIf you want that first sale fast, pulling a PR stunt could do the trick.\n\nMuch like viral videos, a PR stunt has the potential to propel your brand into fame. If executed well, you\u2019ll be swapping conventional time-consuming brand marketing with instant publicity, gaining loyal followers and customers in the process.\n\nA PR stunt involves doing something unusual, outrageous, hilarious\u2014basically something remarkable enough to be worthy of media attention.\n\nAs a result, your store could benefit from tons of links from authoritative news sources, which is great for both traffic in the short term and SEO in the long term.\n\nNo company pulls a better PR stunt than Virgin. Their founder, Richard Branson, has dressed up as a wedding bride, jumped off a casino roof, posed as a Zulu warrior, driven a tank down Fifth Avenue in NYC, and flown a balloon around the world, among many other newsworthy things.\n\nStunt videos, flash mobs, themed events, and guerilla marketing are just some ideas you could use. However, if you\u2019d like some tamer suggestions, you could consider charity events or creating giant replicas of your product to capture attention.\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of examples from the past year to get your creative juices flowing. Take Penguin, for example, who created an unburnable version of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in response to book bans. Or Airbnb, which partnered with nonprofits and governments to secure housing for 100,000 refugees. Is there some way you can alter your product to strike a chord with current events?\n\n11. Experiment With Google Ads\n\nGoogle Ads (formerly AdWords) is Google\u2019s hugely popular pay-per-click advertising network that allows online retailers to place advertisements on nearly every Google search results page, YouTube video, and partner website.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to rank in the top three of a search query that drives sales? Here\u2019s what shows up when you type \u201cConverse\u201d into Google. Note that the first Google Shopping results are paid ads from Converse.\n\nThe beauty of Google Ads lies in its speed and massive reach. In just a few minutes, you can set up and launch an advertising campaign that gets your text, image, or even video ads seen by browsers all over the web.\n\nWith Google Ads, you can create targeted campaigns that show up in Google searches when users look for specific keywords. Your ads can also appear on websites and alongside articles that use similar keywords, getting your ads in front of your target audience.\n\nSetting up a Google Ads account is easy! Just follow these simple steps:\n\nGo to the Google Ads website and click on Start Now. Choose the goal you want to achieve with your ads, such as increasing website traffic, generating leads or sales, or promoting your app. Set your budget and bidding strategy. You can choose from several bidding strategies, like manual bidding or automated bidding. Create your first ad campaign. Consider the keywords your target audience might use to find your product or service and create targeted ads that appeal to them. Launch your campaign and monitor its performance using the data provided by Google Ads.\n\nMake adjustments as needed to optimize your campaign\u2019s performance. For more info, check out my Google Ads step-by-step guide.\n\n12. Segment Your Audience\n\nWant to increase your chances of conversion? Then use personalization.\n\nWhy? Simply because you don\u2019t want to offer the same products to everyone visiting your store. Instead, segment your traffic and show visitors the items they\u2019re more likely to buy.\n\nAll you need is the data from your customers\u2019 previous searches, and you can display items they\u2019ve already shown a keen interest in.\n\nIt\u2019s an approach that works for Amazon. If you search for a product on Amazon or buy something, the first thing you\u2019ll see on its homepage are messages such as:\n\nYou might also like\n\nOften repurchased\n\nBuy again\n\nKeep shopping for\n\nSelected for\n\nAs a dominating force in e-commerce, Amazon knows what it\u2019s doing. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t do it too.\n\nYou can also personalize in other ways, such as by:\n\nFocusing on different segments of the market (i.e., financial, marketing, project management sectors, etc.).\n\nTargeting by behavior, location, referring URL, ad content, device, search keywords, and customer history.\n\nLooking at session behavior, like date and even time of day.\n\nIf you can\u2019t personalize pages like this, perhaps try inbound funnel segmentation. Line up the specific product pages with the source, medium, or channel someone\u2019s coming from.\n\n13. Share the Load With Affiliate Marketing\n\nTrying to sell your products alone can be difficult, so why not share the load with others?\n\nAffiliate marketing is when you partner with other brands to market your products in their content. In return, you pay them a percentage of any sales that originate from their promotions. You can track their marketing efforts by providing a unique hyperlink or coupon code.\n\nFor example, a website owner may post your affiliate link for a blue sweater for sale on your website. If one of his website visitors clicks the link and then buys the blue sweater, you\u2019ll have made a sale, and as an affiliate, the website owner gets a percentage.\n\nAffiliate marketing\u2019s success depends heavily on the types of products you sell and the commission percentage you reward affiliate partners.\n\nTo get started, check out my explanatory affiliate marketing guide, which goes into great detail about the different strategies and methods you\u2019ll need to know.\n\n14. Sell Wholesale to Other Retailers\n\nSelling to consumers is fine, but selling wholesale might be just what you need to get the sales going.\n\nOne of the main advantages of selling wholesale is the obvious increase in cash flow. A lower profit margin might exist, but quantity can make up for the difference.\n\nAdditionally, you enable other companies and resellers to market for you, spreading the word about your merchandise as they buy it themselves. This means selling wholesale could indirectly boost your consumer sales.\n\nFor a crash course on the basics of selling wholesale, check out Shopify\u2019s guide to running a wholesale business.\n\n15. Publish a Press Release\n\nYou\u2019ve issued a press release, and you\u2019re expecting a queue of journalist inquiries and a ton of visitors. Instead, you get little in the way of traction, and you wonder why you bothered.\n\nGetting ignored by every news outlet when distributing a new press release is demoralizing and often a huge waste of resources.\n\nThe secret to getting noticed is simple. Don\u2019t publish a lousy press release, and ensure it\u2019s newsworthy.\n\nHere are some tips for writing a press release:\n\nHave a clear and attention-grabbing headline summarizing the news, and use subheadings for clarity.\n\nStart with a strong lead paragraph that summarizes the news concisely. It should answer the five W\u2019s (who, what, when, where, and why).\n\nGive more information in the body of the release. Make it concise and use quotes from relevant parties if possible.\n\nInclude relevant facts and figures to support your news.\n\nEnd with a short, strong concluding paragraph that reinforces the message and includes a call to action.\n\nAdd contact information for further inquiries and relevant social media handles.\n\nProvide clear images.\n\nTo distribute your press release:\n\nResearch the media outlets relevant to your industry or niche. You can use tools like Muck Rack or HARO to find journalists who cover your topic.\n\nPersonalize your pitch and outreach emails, and include relevant contextual information. Ensure you offer a value proposition for why the journalist or outlet would want to cover your news.\n\nConsider offering exclusives or early access to some outlets to increase your chance of coverage.\n\nUse a distribution service like PRLog or Pressat to reach a wider audience and increase your chances of relevant news wires and outlets picking up your release.\n\nShare your release on social media and consider boosting its reach with a small paid promotion budget.\n\nVary your release depending on where you\u2019re distributing it. For instance, if it\u2019s a local newspaper, base it on your local business starting up. If you\u2019re contacting a national publication, use a broader, more topical angle.\n\nMonitor the coverage and follow up with journalists and bloggers who covered your news. Building a relationship with them can increase your chances of getting coverage in the future.\n\nNot sure where to start with drafting your release? Download templates from HubSpot.\n\n16. Pay Attention to Site Analytics\n\nThe behavior of every website visitor from entry to exit helps you understand why you are selling and, more importantly, why you aren\u2019t.\n\nYour website stats (or analytics) will show you what your customers are doing on your site, including which web pages they enter, the time they spend on particular pages, and the route they take to leave your site. Occasionally, some tools display additional information\u2014for instance, how frequently a customer visits your site.\n\nIt won\u2019t cost you a penny, either. Google Analytics is a free service allowing you to measure your traffic in more ways than you can imagine.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of Google Analytics in action from White Chalk Road.\n\nYou can measure who visits your website, where they come from, and how users interact with it.\n\nWhile you\u2019re fighting for your first sale, it\u2019s extremely important to spend time analyzing your traffic in Google Analytics. You never know what you\u2019ll learn.\n\nIf you need a hand getting started, read my article on how to navigate Google Analytics like a pro. If you haven\u2019t migrated to GA4 yet, then read my guide on doing so, too.\n\n17. Run a Survey\n\nConsumer surveys are an ideal tool for obtaining honest feedback. Unlike your friends and family, consumers have no qualms about hurting your feelings by picking at your web design or your marketing material.\n\nTo run your very own survey, you can make use of online apps like Survey Monkey and Qualaroo to create online surveys.\n\nQuestionPro has a list of 45+ questions to ask e-commerce visitors, which can help you get the most out of your feedback.\n\n18. Network on Social Media Groups or Forums\n\nOnline discussion forums and social media groups are great places to share industry tips and advice, answer questions, and acquire customers.\n\nUse Google or Facebook to find active forums and groups directly related to your niche. Twitter chats and Discord are also venues for niche discussion groups.\n\nWhen you post, ensure you aren\u2019t breaking any rules by promoting your brand or products. Get to know the forums\u2019 restrictions and stick to them. Using your forum avatar, signature, and profile page to promote your brand is usually well within the rules.\n\nNo group will tolerate constant promotion or posts with links to your website. Besides, it makes you look spammy. Keep it simple by posting just enough for people to notice your activity but not enough to constitute spam.\n\nTwo popular business-focused forums worth getting active on are Digital Point and Warrior Forum, which have thriving, helpful communities.\n\n19. Build the Right Relationships\n\nIt\u2019s not what you know. It\u2019s who you know. So building the right online and offline relationships can be your portal to success.\n\nNo matter what type of product you sell or which industry you work within, there are like-minded businesses out there you need to befriend.\n\nThe trick is building relationships with others closely aligned with your business rather than direct competitors.\n\nFor example, suppliers, blogs, and websites focusing on your industry are ideal. They can help provide you with consumer feedback and offer promotional deals without stepping on your digital toes.\n\nTake The Ecommerce Group, for example. Operating via a Facebook group, they have over 8,500 members sharing advice, giving feedback, and providing a helping hand whenever possible.\n\n20. Offer a Contest or Giveaway\n\nEverybody loves free stuff, and if you\u2019re looking to build up some trust while kick-starting your online sales efforts, a contest or giveaway could help you do just that.\n\nNot only can contests and giveaways help you build valuable inbound links, but they\u2019re also a great way to show potential customers they can trust you and that your brand means business.\n\nTease Tea ran a simple contest on their Facebook page.\n\nThis contest costs no money to run and likely took only a few minutes to put together.\n\nThe pizzeria also used its post to get inspiration from Facebook users. That\u2019s a great idea if you\u2019re feeling stuck and want audience input. And, of course, it\u2019s an engagement goldmine.\n\nOnline services like ViralSweep and Gleam enable you to run such contests and giveaways online, helping you to keep things simple and professional without all the added work.\n\n21. Begin Tweeting\n\nTwitter\u2019s simplicity makes it one of the most effective ways to engage with your target market. An excellent method for finding potential customers is proactively searching for people tweeting questions about your industry and reaching out to them.\n\nThe idea is not to pitch or mention your products, just to be helpful. Let\u2019s say you sell sneakers. If you see someone asking questions about which type is best for ankle stability or arch support, respond to them.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to link to your store. However, you want to include your URL on your Twitter profile so users can click through.\n\nThis was the strategy used by Neil Jhaveri when building Mimestream, a native MacOS client for Gmail.\n\nNeil created hundreds of tweets about how he was coding his app and the problems he faced. He also asked his audience for their opinion. His strategy worked wonders; he acquired over 160,000 beta users over a two-year period.\n\n22. Make Connections on LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is the office block of the internet. You\u2019ll find professionals and executives of all types boasting about their abilities and connecting with others.\n\nSet up your e-commerce business profile and you can do the same. You may not make any direct sales through LinkedIn, but you\u2019ll discover an array of opportunities with other companies, suppliers, and related websites.\n\nLinkedIn Groups also are a stellar way to engage with other business owners in your industry. Many public and private groups are available for specific niches, allowing you to post questions and converse with other members.\n\nTo find relevant Groups, search on LinkedIn or ask your followers what groups they recommend.\n\n23. Go Visual With Pinterest, Instagram, or TikTok\n\nPinterest, Instagram, and TikTok are all excellent platforms for engaging potential customers visually. Whether you prefer videos or photos, using visuals allows your prospects to absorb information easier. Additionally, they help bring your products to life and inform the buying decision.\n\nThese platforms are the perfect place to present the creativity and passion that goes into your business behind the scenes. Snap pictures of your products, take manufacturing process videos, tell a story with images, provide demonstrations and introduce your staff.\n\nThese social media channels also complement your e-commerce sales efforts, attracting new customers and driving traffic to your store while enhancing brand awareness.\n\nHere are some tips for getting the most out of each platform:\n\nInstagram:\n\nUse high-quality images and follow resolution guidelines. Optimize your images for Instagram\u2019s algorithm using hashtags in captions. Keep your product images consistent with your branding to create a cohesive visual aesthetic. Use Instagram stories to show a more behind-the-scenes look at your brand and showcase your products in day-to-day use.\n\nPinterest:\n\nOptimize your pins using keyword-rich descriptions for your images. Design highly pinnable graphics that showcase your products or services with eye-catching visuals. Use Rich Pins. These provide metadata and give additional details about your products. Take advantage of seasonality and trends by creating boards specific to the holiday, season, or event. Highlight your products and give links back to your store.\n\nTikTok:\n\nUse trending music and hashtags to help your posts reach a wider audience. Add video editing features such as filters, effects, and transitions to make your content more engaging and visually interesting. Personalize content for your audience by considering region, language, and cultural variations. Keep up with the trends and always create new types of content to keep your audiences engaged.\n\nNeed some visual inspiration? Melt Cosmetics started as a new brand but now has 3 million followers on Instagram.\n\nThey are doing a great job of Instagram marketing, building a brand image and a following with their beautiful photographs.\n\n24. Don\u2019t Forget Facebook\n\nOK, so maybe Facebook isn\u2019t as popular as it once was. However, with nearly 3 billion monthly active users, it\u2019s still well worthwhile.\n\nBegin by leveraging your personal Facebook profile and your business page to engage with friends, family, and acquaintances and get people talking about your products. Then, get creative with status updates and interact on public groups and fan pages relevant to your niche. For instance, a popular blow-drying salon in Toronto called Drybar has an extremely engaged Facebook community of over 200,000 who talk all things blow-drying.\n\nIf you\u2019re fresh out of ideas for your Facebook business page, check out my ultimate guide to social media e-commerce.\n\n25. Beat the Competition on Comparison Shopping Engines\n\nMost consumers like to shop around before making a purchase. This includes visits to search engines and sites like Amazon.\n\nPopular engines include Google Shopping, PriceGrabber, Amazon, and a range of others, all simultaneously comparing thousands of products and stores.\n\nThere are many advantages to using price comparison, including:\n\nIncreased visibility: By listing your products on price comparison sites, you increase their visibility to potential customers who might not have found them otherwise. Potential for increased online sales: Customers who use price comparison sites are often looking for the best deal, and if your store offers competitive prices, you can attract these customers and convert them into buyers. Increased trust: Listing your products on reputable price comparison sites can help build trust with customers who might otherwise be wary of shopping with an unknown online store. Cost-effective advertising: Price comparison sites like Google Shopping offer free listings or low-cost advertising options, making them a cost-effective way to drive traffic to your e-commerce store.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from where I\u2019m searching for a price comparison on my favorite hot sauce:\n\nTo get noticed, you need to play by the rules of each engine, stay competitive in terms of price, and play the waiting game while experimenting to find out which engine suits you and gives you the best ROI.\n\nShopify has a list of the 30 most popular comparison shopping engines with brief explanations of each one and how to use them to drive traffic.\n\n26. Create an Infographic\n\nAn infographic is exactly what the name implies, a graph of information\u2014and they are really easy to create these days using tools like Canva, PowerPoint, and Word.\n\nInfographics are gold when it comes to social shares and search engine traffic. According to Venngage, 36.4% of marketers used original graphics like infographics in 2021. And for good reason. They can easily double your traffic.\n\nThese infographics impact your online sales in other ways, like:\n\nIncreased engagement: Infographics are eye-catching and can grab attention quickly, making them more likely to get social shares, and they work well. According to research by HubSpot, 56 percent of marketers say infographics are their most effective type of content.\n\nInfographics are eye-catching and can grab attention quickly, making them more likely to get social shares, and they work well.

Improved comprehension: Complex information can be difficult to understand when presented in text alone. However, infographics provide visual aids like charts, graphs, and images to make information more digestible. People often prefer visual learning, and some retain and understand information better this way.\n\nComplex information can be difficult to understand when presented in text alone.

Better SEO: Infographics can also help improve your search engine ranking by increasing website backlinks when others share them online.\n\nIn fact, according to Pixel Productions, which has created an inspiring and detailed guide to marketing with infographics, they can boost web traffic by up to 12 percent.\n\n27. Design Your Store to Look the Part\n\nFirst impressions count, especially regarding your website design. I\u2019m talking about more than mere aesthetics here. Of course, your website should look good. However, it must also provide a good user experience (UX).\n\nNot a designer? That doesn\u2019t matter! Begin with the basics. Look at the store from a visitor\u2019s perspective. What would make the store easy to use? Consider simplifying navigation, having lots of white space, and avoiding clutter.\n\nMaking your store mobile responsive is also crucial. More than half of all internet traffic comes from mobile devices, so make sure your site works and looks good on phones and tablets.\n\nIf you are using WordPress, look for themes that are specifically designed for e-commerce.\n\nTo get some creative ideas about your own store\u2019s design, have a look at my guide on designing an e-commerce store that converts.\n\n28. Host a Pop-Up Store\n\nJust because your store began on the internet doesn\u2019t mean you have to stick purely to online marketing. An e-commerce pop-up store could be just what you need to complement your website.\n\nUnlike traditional brick-and-mortar premises, a pop-up store is temporary and costs much less. However, it\u2019s vital to remember that location is everything.\n\nYou can open a pop-up store at farmers\u2019 markets, art fairs, shopping malls, galleries, and any other bustling area. Just ensure you\u2019re set up in a clearly visible area where your target market will likely wander.\n\nIn addition, a pop-up store can act as a great offline marketing outpost. You can use your store to hand out coupons for your online store, give out business cards, invite people to sign up for your newsletter, and encourage more social media followers.\n\n29. Document Your Launch on Reddit\n\nReddit is a socially powered news and entertainment website where users submit content. More importantly, Reddit is a place where you can attract a large number of dedicated followers and customers.\n\nUsing the r/entrepreneur subreddit, in particular, you can introduce your brand, gain consumer feedback, learn lessons, and promote your products.\n\nThe process has to be one of give and take, though. Walk those entrepreneurial Redditors through your journey, take them behind the scenes, detail your mistakes, and expose some personality to gain customers and fans, too.\n\nA brilliant example of using Reddit to promote an online store is what the guys at Beardbrand did. The beard grooming specialists documented their launch on the r/entrepreneur subreddit, getting valuable advice from subscribers and customers while giving back to them via regular updates and inside information.\n\nReddit can be a potent tool, but it can also be fickle. Take time to understand the community before diving in, follow business promotion guidelines, and don\u2019t take the hard sales approach.\n\n30. Communicate the Product\u2019s Value Proposition\n\nLast but certainly not least, a clear value prop can make all the difference in making your first e-commerce sale.\n\nWhy is your product worth buying? What are its benefits? How will it help the buyer? Your answer to those questions should be the \u2018end result\u2019 that will ultimately make someone\u2019s life better.\n\nYour value proposition should \u201cboil down\u201d your sales pitch (and all the complexities associated with it) into something the buyer can easily understand and remember, grab their attention and eventually say, \u201cYes, that\u2019s the one for me.\u201d Because \u201cif you\u2019re the best in at least one way, you\u2019re the best option for the people who value that aspect.\u201d\n\nCases in point: Apple, not the largest selection of products; QVC, not necessarily prestigious; Tiffany, definitely not the cheapest. But people still buy from them.\n\nMake sure your value prop is incredibly simple; requiring less than a few seconds of thought.\n\nThat means no big words. No run-on sentences. No generic garbage. No \u201ccollaboration,\u201d or \u201ceffectiveness,\u201d or other synergies.\n\nIf you\u2019re still struggling, visuals can help add context. For e-commerce, think about showing the product in action.\n\nShort videos also work well, as evidenced by Dollar Shave Club\u2019s infamous viral one they still use front-and-center today.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow do I start selling my new product online? Assuming you\u2019ve researched your products and identified an audience, your next step is finding an e-commerce host and setting up a functional website to sell your product. This will be your online storefront, where customers learn more about your product and (hopefully) make a purchase.\n\nNext, create compelling product descriptions that entice your customers. Here, you want to think about the benefits of your product. What problem does it solve for your customers? Take the time to create product descriptions focusing on the benefits, not just the features.\n\nNow, test your site for any tech issues and complete a few test sales to ensure all areas work smoothly.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s time to start driving traffic through social media and SEO. If you\u2019re thinking of increasing your online sales fast, consider paid advertising. Keep testing your promotional methods to see which works best for you. How can I speed up my sales? Focus on getting your first few sales and use those to gain momentum. Ask for reviews and testimonials from your first customers and maybe offer a small discount if they introduce other customers.\n\nAlso. optimize your website for conversions. This means creating clear, compelling calls to action and minimizing distractions that might detract from the purchasing process.\n\nYou could also try retargeting ads to reach customers who have already shown an interest in your product.\n\nAnother effective strategy is to personalize your marketing messages. Use data about your customers\u2019 preferences and behavior to create targeted campaigns that speak directly to their needs and interests. Why am I not getting any sales? There are several potential reasons for this. Your first step should be to check for indexing or tech issues that could impact your visibility.\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t help, it\u2019s time to revisit your marketing strategy and keyword usage. Have you optimized your website to reach your ideal customers? Are you blogging and building a mailing list? Are you visible on social media?\n\nThen look at more specific reasons. If you\u2019re getting visitors but have poor sales, perhaps your website design needs some work and navigation needs improving. Test different layouts to see if this helps.\n\nAlso, look at pricing to ensure it\u2019s competitive, offer more shipping services in case that\u2019s an issue, and include a strong call to action.\n\nFinally, ask friends or family to test the site and see if they encounter any difficulties during checkout.\n\nConclusion\n\nSetting up your e-commerce store is no easy task, but now you know how to make your first sale online. The 30 strategies listed above are stellar ways to kick-start sales for your e-commerce store and start your business off strong.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to use all of the ideas in this article. If you do, you\u2019re likely to experience overwhelm.\n\nSelect various methods that give you a good mix for your online sales strategy and have an analytics system in place so you can see what is working.\n\nTry, test, and keep going until you increase sales and attract repeat customers.\n\nWhich strategy will you use to make your first online sales?\n\nSee How My Agency Can Drive More Traffic to Your Website SEO - unlock more SEO traffic.

Understanding them provides valuable insight into why some customers convert \u2014 and some don\u2019t.\n\nUnderstanding how \u2014 and when \u2014 consumers interact with your brand is crucial. It makes it easier to target them, provide them with the information they need, and move them closer to a purchase.\n\nOnce you know where you\u2019re losing customers, you can adapt your strategy to enhance conversion rates.\n\nSound good? Then let\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nWhat Are Marketing Funnels?\n\nA marketing funnel is a visual representation of the steps a visitor takes from first finding out about your brand until they convert. The most common type of marketing funnel consists of four stages known as AIDA:\n\n1. Attention: A prospective customer sees your ad or social media post or hears about you from a friend.\n\n2. Interest: They think you can solve a problem and want to learn more.\n\n3. Desire: The prospect has done their research and wants to convert.\n\n4. Action: The prospect takes action \u2014 they buy your item, schedule a demo, or take whatever other action you want them to take.\n\nThe action can vary based on the customer and industry \u2014 maybe you want them to make a purchase, sign up, or fill out a form. When someone does something you want them to do, it\u2019s known as a conversion. The visitor converts from browsing to taking the action you want them to take.\n\nThink about Amazon\u2019s marketing funnels. There are several steps a visitor has to go through before they can purchase a product. Here\u2019s how it looks, they:\n\nVisit Amazon.com\n\nView a product\n\nDecide to add a product to the cart\n\nComplete the purchase\n\nThere are additional steps/actions that shoppers can take, but they don\u2019t matter in marketing funnels unless they contribute to the final action. For example, a visitor may view Amazon\u2019s Careers page, but we don\u2019t need to count these in the funnel because they aren\u2019t necessary steps.\n\nWhy is the set of steps to conversion called a \u201cfunnel\u201d? Because at the beginning of the process, there are a lot of people who take the first step.\n\nAs the people continue along and take the next steps, some of them drop out, and the size of the crowd thins or narrows. As a result, only some people in the funnel convert. Just the most interested buyers move further down.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201cwidening the funnel?\u201d\n\nThis refers to casting a larger net by advertising to new audiences, increasing brand awareness, or using inbound marketing to drive more people to the site. The more people in the funnel, the wider it is.\n\nWhat Are the Different Types of Funnels?\n\nAll marketing funnels start with some sort of advertising. That might be a PPC ad, content marketing campaign, white paper download, video ad, social media ad, or even an IRL ad.\n\nTypes of funnels you might hear about include:\n\nSales funnels\n\nWebinar funnels\n\nEmail funnels\n\nVideo marketing funnels\n\nLead magnet funnels\n\nHome page funnels\n\nDespite the different names, these all track the same thing \u2014 the steps a prospective customer takes to conversion.\n\nWhat Can You Use a Marketing Funnel For?\n\nAside from attracting sign-ups and purchases, marketing funnels have many other purposes. You can put funnels all over your website to see how visitors move through a specific website flow.\n\nYou may want to track newsletter signups. (Viewing newsletter signup form > Submitting form > Confirming email) or a simple page conversion (Viewing a signup page > Submitting signup).\n\nFigure out your goals and what you want visitors to do on your site, and you can create a funnel for it.\n\nOnce you have the data, you can see roadblocks and optimize your funnel marketing. Let\u2019s dig a little deeper into that.\n\nWhy Are Marketing Funnels Beneficial?\n\nMarketing funnels provide access to data, called a marketing funnel report, which lets you see where you are losing customers. This is sometimes called a \u201cleaky\u201d funnel because it allows customers you want to keep to escape the funnel.\n\nLet\u2019s take your average SaaS business as an example. Here\u2019s how a funnel may look for them:\n\nVisited site\n\nSigned up for a trial\n\nUsed product\n\nUpgraded to paying\n\nDo people have to use the product before paying? They don\u2019t, but it\u2019s a good idea to track it so you can see if it\u2019s a roadblock.\n\nFor example, if you lose numerous conversions after the trial stage, you might need to update your onboarding process so people understand how to use the tool. Alternatively, you can adjust the top of your funnel to avoid attracting people outside your target audience.\n\nA Real-Life Marketing Funnel Example\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at an e-commerce purchase funnel.\n\nThe e-commerce store has a bird\u2019s eye view of what is happening within the funnel because it tracks conversions like this:\n\nBuyer adds an item to cart\n\nBuyer proceeds to billing and shipping\n\nBuyer completes payment\n\nBuyer proceeds to purchase completed process\n\nTheir marketing funnel would look something like this example from Smartlook:\n\nOkay, now we understand what a funnel is and why it helps. Next, let\u2019s look at Google Analytics.\n\nHow Google Analytics Marketing Funnels Work\n\nGoogle Analytics offers marketing funnels. They\u2019re possibly one of the simplest ways to track prospects\u2019 paths before they convert. Simply sign in, then head to Admin > Goals > +New Goal > Choose a Goal to create a Google Analytics goal. You can learn more about the different types of Goals you can make in Google\u2019s documentation.\n\nEasy, right?\n\nHowever, here are a couple of things to consider when creating funnels in Google Analytics:\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty basic funnel: If you don\u2019t want to dive deep into the data and optimize, you can go with this.\n\nYou cannot go back and retroactively view data: Once you create your funnel, you can only see the funnel going forward as fresh data comes in.\n\nOverall, if you are new to marketing funnels, Google Analytics funnels is a solid place to start.\n\nHow to Create a Marketing Funnel\n\nYou can use several models to create successful marketing funnels that convert. Let\u2019s discuss some techniques you can use in your funnel marketing efforts, starting with the ideal buyer journey.\n\n1. Determine Your Ideal Buyer Journey and Map It Out as a Funnel\n\nA conversion funnel aims to build an effective buyer\u2019s journey and increase your conversions. However, you must first identify your starting point and end goal to do this. In other words, you must determine three things:\n\nWhat your typical buyer\u2019s journey looks like right now\n\nWhat your end goal is, or what action you want a prospect to take\n\nHow you can improve your existing buyer\u2019s journey to increase the likelihood of leads becoming paying customers\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified your end goal, you can map it out as a marketing funnel. Visualizing or mapping out your funnel can help you stay on track further down the line.\n\n2. Set Goals for Each Stage in Your Funnel\n\nIt helps to think of your marketing funnels in three parts: the top, middle, and bottom. This visual from WordStream shows how your goals differ at each stage.\n\nDecide what you want from each stage of the funnel. For example, you might want to increase your traffic at the top of the funnel, boost your engagement rate in the middle, and improve your conversions at the end.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set concrete goals, consider using tools to track your progress and ensure you meet those objectives. For instance, you could use Google Analytics or email automation software to measure your success rates.\n\n3. Make a Content Plan for Each Stage in the Funnel\n\nEach part of the funnel (top, middle, bottom) requires its own marketing plan to keep prospects moving from one stage to the next.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down.\n\nTop: Build brand and product awareness. Use visually engaging content such as videos, short blog posts, and social media posts to introduce your company and emphasize your brand story.\n\nBuild brand and product awareness. Use visually engaging content such as videos, short blog posts, and social media posts to introduce your company and emphasize your brand story. Middle: Gain trust and demonstrate how you can meet your customers\u2019 needs. A prospect could be in this stage for a while, so the focus should be on creating valuable, informative, and reliable content such as case studies, video tutorials, and downloads.\n\nGain trust and demonstrate how you can meet your customers\u2019 needs. A prospect could be in this stage for a while, so the focus should be on creating valuable, informative, and reliable content such as case studies, video tutorials, and downloads. Bottom: Give prospects a reason to buy, sign up, or take action. Marketing strategies at this stage could include free trials, actionable emails, CTAs, or calls to action.\n\n4. Implement Strategies and Create Content to Generate Awareness\n\nYou\u2019re trying to build hype around your brand and product at the first stage in your marketing funnel. Why should a customer care about your company? How do your products solve the problems they have? Answer these questions to help build a content strategy for this phase.\n\nDo some competitor research, too. Consider what you can learn from their landing pages, social media channels, and blogs. How are they reeling in potential customers?\n\nUse tools like Ubersuggest to discover your main competitors. Analyze their landing pages and blog content to find elements that you can replicate or improve upon.\n\nMonitor their social media channels with social listening tools. Ensure you check the type of content they are posting, the engagement they are receiving, and their overall social media strategy. Use what you find to inspire your own strategy.\n\nYou can also use tools like Buzzsumo to discover viral content and analyze popular articles. What makes them buzz-worthy? Try and emulate them.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a content plan, but it\u2019s not much good on its own. You need to know how to attract and create desire.\n\n5. Generate Interest and Desire\n\nWhile the AIDA model labels \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d as two different outcomes, they\u2019re the same thing in real terms.\n\nGenerating interest, or building desire, comes down to one key thing \u2014 creating compelling content. Your content should:\n\nBuild some awareness around your brand\n\nShow people why they \u201cneed\u201d what you\u2019re selling\n\nGet consumers to decide they \u201cwant\u201d your product.\n\nHow do you create great content to nudge people along this stage of your funnel? Here are some ideas.\n\nProvide Valuable Content: Craft authoritative blog posts to educate your audience. If users find your content valuable, they\u2019re more likely to trust you enough to spend money on your products.\n\nCraft authoritative blog posts to educate your audience. If users find your content valuable, they\u2019re more likely to trust you enough to spend money on your products. Use Video: Show your product in action by creating a YouTube video. Video content helps people visualize how the product could benefit them, making them feel like they \u201cneed\u201d the item.\n\nShow your product in action by creating a YouTube video. Video content helps people visualize how the product could benefit them, making them feel like they \u201cneed\u201d the item. Send Curated Emails: If you have a prospect\u2019s contact details, send them curated email content such as roundups of your top blog posts, customer testimonials, or other tips that could benefit your reader.\n\nIf you have a prospect\u2019s contact details, send them curated email content such as roundups of your top blog posts, customer testimonials, or other tips that could benefit your reader. Share Customer Success Stories: Sharing success stories from happy customers is a great way to show the benefits of your product and how it can help others achieve their goals.\n\nSharing success stories from happy customers is a great way to show the benefits of your product and how it can help others achieve their goals. Use Comparison Content: Differentiate yourself by comparing your offering to similar ones in the market. Highlight the unique benefits to show why it\u2019s the best choice for potential customers.\n\nDifferentiate yourself by comparing your offering to similar ones in the market. Highlight the unique benefits to show why it\u2019s the best choice for potential customers. Use Expert Content: Establish your authority in the industry by providing expert content such as research reports, case studies, or whitepapers. This showcases the value of your product or service to potential customers and helps them understand how it can benefit them.\n\nThere are other ways you can generate interest, too, such as starting a podcast, creating product guides, running a free trial program, or offering product samples.\n\n6. Encourage Users to Take Action\n\nAt the end of the marketing funnel, your goal is to convert a lead into a customer by encouraging the necessary action. Your desired action may differ according to your business strategy. Here are some examples of actions you may want your prospects to take.\n\nCreate a PDF Download\n\nPut some valuable content in a PDF download and offer it in exchange for a prospect\u2019s contact details. Ensure your document promises to answer common customer questions to encourage them to download it.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from LegalSuite, a legal services provider. Their customers typically want help with streamlining their operational efficiency. To help their customers, LegalSuite offers a free eBook with ways to make their legal operations run more efficiently.\n\nThe catch? Prospects must provide some contact details, which means that LegalSuite can follow up with them:\n\nThis is an excellent example of encouraging action without being pushy.\n\nAdd a Call to Action (CTA) to Relevant Resources\n\nCTAs clarify the action you want people to take, so don\u2019t forget to add them to your content. Here\u2019s a great example from jewelry retailer Pura Vida bracelets.\n\nAt this marketing funnel stage, you\u2019re trying to entice customers to take a final step to complete the cycle. Therefore, give your CTAs a sense of urgency. Emphasize how your product can solve their problem and why they should act now.\n\nMake it easy for customers to act by displaying the CTA somewhere prominent, like the top of a landing page, the end of a guidepost, or a colorful, clickable button at a strategic point in a YouTube video.\n\nFinally, test your CTAs to identify which strategy resonates most with your audience.\n\nSend Actionable Emails\n\nIn many ways, great marketing is all about helping people help themselves.\n\nSend them clear, concise, actionable emails emphasizing how they can solve their problems by buying your products or using your services.\n\nAgain, ensure there\u2019s an obvious CTA so potential customers know what action you expect them to take.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a starting point, Tutsplus.com has some free email newsletter templates.\n\nIncorporate Customer Testimonials\n\nDid you know that 72 percent of customers won\u2019t purchase until they\u2019ve read some reviews? Give those customers the reassurance they need to take the final step by adding testimonials to your page.\n\nYou can either ask customers for reviews or look at your existing reviews on websites like Facebook and LinkedIn and ask permission to share them in your content.\n\nWhere should you display testimonials?\n\nIt all depends on your audience, brand goals, and marketing strategy. You could, for example:\n\nInclude some quotes from positive reviews on your landing page\n\nEmbed a widget from a website like Trustpilot on your page so prospects can read your reviews before they buy\n\nLink to videos of happy customers using your products (remember to thank them for trying out your product, too!)\n\nAdd testimonials to your product/services pages\n\nUse testimonials on landing pages to persuade visitors to take a specific action, such as signing up for a free trial or subscribing to a newsletter\n\nShare customer testimonials on your social media channels to showcase the positive experiences your customers have had with your brand\n\nEyewear brand Warby Parker groups their customer testimonials by topic on a specific reviews page.\n\nOther Ideas\n\nFinally, offer other incentives like free trials, competitor comparison guides, demo videos, and product samples to nurture leads into becoming paying customers.\n\n7. Keep Customers\n\nGreat marketing is about more than finding customers. It\u2019s about retaining them, too. Acquiring new customers can cost up to five times more than retaining existing ones so retention is a skill you must master.\n\nIn addition to the cost benefits, did you know your existing customers are roughly 50% more likely to try your new products? Armed with this knowledge, you have the potential to experiment with different approaches at the top of your retention funnel. For example, you could remind loyal customers of the value of your product or provide updates about exciting new developments.\n\nSounds great, right? Here are some strategies for retaining those all-important loyal customers.\n\nNext-sell: This is when you follow up with a customer after purchase and offer them a similar product with, perhaps, an attractive discount attached. This allows you to communicate with your customer and make them feel valued, and it\u2019s a way to potentially increase revenue.\n\nThis is when you follow up with a customer after purchase and offer them a similar product with, perhaps, an attractive discount attached.

Create Loyalty Programs: Loyalty programs are crucial to any customer retention strategy, with 81 percent of millennials spending more money when they\u2019re a loyalty scheme member. However, since loyalty schemes are nothing new, you need to get creative.\n\nLoyalty programs are crucial to any customer retention strategy, with 81 percent of millennials spending more money when they\u2019re a loyalty scheme member. However, since loyalty schemes are nothing new, you need to get creative. Product Updates: When you update your products, you\u2019re keeping up with evolving customer demands and changing expectations; you\u2019re showing your loyal customers that you value their continued loyalty.\n\nOther techniques include Introducing member-only events, sending out exclusive emails, running contests or prize draws, and starting a customer service RSS feed.\n\n8. Grow Customers\n\nFinally, don\u2019t forget to capitalize on your existing customers by encouraging them to purchase more. You could try a few strategies to incorporate into a growth marketing funnel. Here\u2019s an example of what that might look like:\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how you can grow customers:\n\nCross-selling : Look at a customer\u2019s most recent purchase and show them similar products they might be interested in. Or, during the sales process, offer them other items that complement their purchase.\n\n: Look at a customer\u2019s most recent purchase and show them similar products they might be interested in. Or, during the sales process, offer them other items that complement their purchase. Upselling: Offer customers a more expensive alternative to the item or service they\u2019re interested in. When you\u2019re upselling, comparing products or services side-by-side is helpful. However, don\u2019t try to upsell a product if it\u2019s substantially more expensive than the potential customer wants and avoid being too pushy. Otherwise, the strategy could backfire!\n\nHere\u2019s a good example of upselling from Best Buy. The customer views a MacBook Air selling at $999.99. Below the product, they see other products from the MacBook range. The first option is more expensive but also has an enticing discount attached to it:\n\nThe products advertised aren\u2019t massively different in price from the viewed product, and it\u2019s a good, subtle example of upselling.\n\nThere are a few other strategies you can try to grow your customer base and build your business, including:\n\nSending out discounts to loyal customers\n\nPersonalizing your marketing emails\n\nIssuing more voucher codes\n\nTest out a few options and identify which resonates best with your customers.\n\nOptimizing Your Marketing Funnel\n\nIn reality, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect marketing funnel. However, if your marketing funnels are underperforming, it could be due to common errors such as:\n\nLeaving out a strong CTA\n\nForgetting to start with a clear brand message\n\nUsing too many steps in your funnel\n\nMisreading your funnel analytics data\n\nFailing to follow up with leads\n\nWeak offers that don\u2019t resonate with prospects\n\nLack of personalization, making engagement difficult\n\nConsider the following ways to audit and optimize your marketing funnel.\n\nAnalyze Your Landing Page and Sign-Up Forms\n\nTake a look at your landing page and test the following elements:\n\nHeadlines: Test different headlines to see which ones attract and keep the most visitors.\n\nTest different headlines to see which ones attract and keep the most visitors.

Also test different font styles to see how they impact conversion. Purchase Path: Test the path to purchase to eliminate any friction you uncover. Tip: lowering the page loading speed may be your biggest culprit when it comes to abandonment rates. Use Google\u2019s PageSpeed Insight tool to test your conversion funnel. You can also uncover the impact slow page load has on conversion during a usability test. Use both in combination to get the optimal purchase path.\n\nTest Your Trust Elements\n\nTrust on the web is huge \u2014 especially when getting people to give you their money. This is why you must build trust in your landing page and throughout your online marketing funnels.\n\nAt a minimum, you need these elements:\n\nGuarantee: Will you give them their money back if they are unsatisfied? Will you do this in 30 days? 60 days? 90 days? Test different variations to see which pulls the best.\n\nWill you give them their money back if they are unsatisfied?

You have to be a local chapter member and pay around $400/year\u2014 a small price to pay for the benefit of putting your customers at ease. VeriSign Logo: The VeriSign logo is an internationally-recognized symbol that your online check-out process is safe and secure. That\u2019s huge. Try to do business without that seal, and your online conversion rates will plummet. You can get a VeriSign seal for less than $300 a year.\n\nReviews and using HTTPS can also boost trust.\n\nUse all three trust elements above for best results, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do a few rounds of A/B testing, experimenting to find out which logo is the most effective. You\u2019ll especially want to find out the best position of each trust element on the page.\n\nThe Morgan & Morgan law firm uses trust symbols, and customer reviews well.\n\nTheir footer also includes relevant trust symbols:\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more about building customer trust, read my article 10 Ways to \u201cGuarantee\u201d More Sales and Conversions for more information and examples.\n\nTest Your Email Conversion\n\nBuilding an email newsletter list is essential to your online conversion funnel. Test these elements in your emails:\n\nOpen Rates : Your email newsletter lives or dies based on your subject lines. Make sure you are using the most compelling copy. Test different variations constantly to raise conversion rates.\n\n: Your email newsletter lives or dies based on your subject lines. Make sure you are using the most compelling copy.

And test different anchor text copies.\n\n: Open rates alone won\u2019t tell you the whole story. Embed links throughout the copy to see if more or fewer links drive people to click.

A great way to find out is to use a simple survey.\n\n: Find out if your audience prefers email in plain text or HTML-based. A great way to find out is to use a simple survey. CTA: Test different calls to action to see which drives more traffic to your site. Also, test the position of these CTAs on the page.\n\nLet\u2019s shift gears now and discuss how to test these different conversion funnel elements.\n\nCombine Usability and A/B Test Results\n\nTalk to most people about metrics, and they\u2019ll either talk about user testing or A/B testing, but rarely both. That\u2019s unfortunate because they work together perfectly.\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\nGet qualitative feedback from users during a usability test: Your first step should be a usability test. This user test can be casual but tightly focused. Just have them focus on the page where conversions matter the most (sign-up form). You would be surprised how much insight you can get from feedback from a very small group.\n\nYour first step should be a usability test. This user test can be casual but tightly focused. Just have them focus on the page where conversions matter the most (sign-up form). You would be surprised how much insight you can get from feedback from a very small group. Analyze your user testing results: This feedback should help guide your design of the page. You should walk away with three or more design alternatives.\n\nThis feedback should help guide your design of the page. You should walk away with three or more design alternatives. Run your A/B testing: Once you have those alternatives and insights from user testing, start your A/B testing. Your A/B testing should help you narrow your choices between design alternatives and on-page elements, eventually landing on the most optimized page performance.\n\nIn the end, A/B testing confirms your usability test insights, giving you more effective results than if either were used alone.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to usability testing, here are some resources to check out:\n\nUsability 101: Introduction to Usability: By Jakob Neilson, the godfather of usability.\n\nUsertesting.com: Get a video of a user talking about your site as they work through it and a written summary of problems they encountered.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to A/B testing, check out our A/B testing guide.\n\nRun A Mom Test\n\nOkay, so it doesn\u2019t have to be your mom, but make sure it isn\u2019t one of your internet-savvy friends. In other words, it should be a regular web user because you want to see how most people navigate your marketing funnel.\n\nCall this person and ask them to find your site on Google and complete the conversion process. Make sure you tell them what you expect users to do.\n\nStay on the phone and ask them to talk out loud as they do their search. Record the phone call and take notes until they are finished.\n\nMake tweaks to your conversion process and repeat the funnel optimization process until people can work through the process without abandoning the process.\n\nRun an Online 5-Second Marketing Funnel Optimization Test\n\nFinally, you must keep things simple when creating a well-built conversion funnel; be sure to eliminate all distractions.\n\nI\u2019ve found that by running a simple visual presentation, you can learn a lot about the simplicity of your marketing funnels.\n\nThis is where the five-second test comes in.\n\nIn marketing, the five-second rule refers to the idea that visitors to a website or consumers of a marketing message make a quick decision about whether to engage with the content or move on within the first five seconds.\n\nIt centers on the notion that people have limited attention spans and are constantly bombarded with information, so marketers must quickly capture their interest and attention. Uxtweak provides a great how-to:\n\nYou can choose from several tools, including:\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the four stages of the AIDA model? The four stages are \u201cAttention,\u201d \u201cInterest,\u201d \u201cDesire,\u201d and \u201cAction.\u201d You\u2019re trying to attract attention, generate interest, encourage customers to want the product and have them take the desired action.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between goals and funnels? The goal is the objective you\u2019re trying to achieve, e.g., a customer completing a sale. The funnel is the journey the prospect takes to reach this goal.\n\nWhy do marketing funnels matter? Marketing funnels provide access to data, called a marketing funnel report, which lets you can see where you are losing customers.\n\nHow do you visualize a funnel? Start by checking out funnel visualization tools like Google Analytics.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a funnel? A marketing funnel shows the paths people take from visiting your website to becoming paying customers.\n\nWhat is a marketing funnel vs. a brand funnel? A marketing funnel, or a sales funnel, refers to the process a customer goes through to become aware of, evaluate, and eventually purchase a product or service. A brand funnel is the customer journey buyers go through until they reach brand loyalty.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve covered just about everything you need to know about marketing funnels. Here\u2019s a quick recap:\n\nWhen someone on your website does something you want them to do (i.e., sign up, make a purchase, fill out a form, etc.), it is known as a conversion.\n\nA funnel tracks the steps that lead up to that conversion. For example, e-commerce companies want people to purchase products on their website. Their funnel may have these steps: visited site > viewed product > placed product in cart > purchased.\n\nA funnel report shows you where people are dropping off in the path to conversion so you can optimize your conversion path and drive revenue.\n\nGoogle Analytics provides funnels as part of the free Google Analytics software. It\u2019s a simple and free way to get started with marketing funnels.\n\nHave you created a marketing funnel in Google Analytics?

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here .\n\nIntrusive Interstitial Pop-up and User Experience\n\nHave you ever been browsing a website and suddenly an interstitial pop-up appears, blocking the entire page and interrupting your experience?\n\nAnnoying right?\n\nAs online shopping continues to become the norm, use your website to capture user information and increase engagement.\n\nBut don\u2019t interrupt the user experience and potentially drive customers away.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate among marketers about whether these pop-ups are effective or actually harming their website\u2019s performance.\n\nThat\u2019s where I come in to put the debate to rest.\n\nWe\u2019ve conducted a data-driven analysis of shopper behavior to determine the impact of interstitial pop-ups on user experience.\n\nHow they felt about intrusive interstitials just might shock you.\n\nWhile we look at what we learned, I\u2019ll explain why interstitials are used and how you can use them effectively.\n\nWhy are Intrusive Interstitials Used?\n\nIntrusive interstitials are attention grabbers.\n\nWant to promote certain content or actions?\n\nUse an interstitial pop-up.\n\nYou can get visitors to:\n\nSign up for your newsletter. Give them a discount code for their first purchase. Download your app to shop on the go.\n\nThey\u2019re essentially any on-page element that appears at different stages in a visitor\u2019s session, generally promotional.\n\nHave you seen my pop-up?\n\nThis quiz page interstitial pop-up has been a very lucrative addition to the site.\n\nI made sure it was optimized for interstitial pop-up SEO and offered a CTA with a CTB (Call-to-Benefit).\n\nThe CTA incorporates an action word: \u201cAnswer.\u201d Then, the visitor can receive an immediate benefit (the 7-week action plan) after analyzing a URL on their website.\n\nPop-ups can serve different purposes for your marketing strategy.\n\nFor example, marketing teams may want to use them to drive conversions and increase revenue, while design teams may use them to showcase new products or features.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that interstitial pop-ups can often be used poorly, leading to negative consequences.\n\nWhen done poorly, intrusive interstitials can hurt organic search performance for several reasons.\n\nFirst, they can disrupt the user experience, causing visitors to bounce from your site.\n\nInterstitial pop-up SEO can ultimately be affected and hurt your site\u2019s search engine ranking, too.\n\nSecondly, Google has implemented penalties for sites that use certain intrusive interstitials, particularly interstitials on mobile. This means that sites that use intrusive interstitials that cover the main content or require users to dismiss them before accessing the content may not rank as high in search results.\n\nSo, while interstitial pop-ups can be an effective tool for promoting certain content or actions on a website, use them strategically to avoid negatively impacting your site.\n\nThe Data on How Users Really Feel About Intrusive Interstitials\n\nOur survey aimed to investigate how users really feel about intrusive interstitials. We conducted a survey that reached 1,000 participants in the US.\n\nTo start, we designed a quiz that consisted of a mix of questions to obtain both qualitative and quantitative data. The questions covered topics, including:\n\nUsers\u2019 experiences with intrusive interstitials\n\nPerceptions of intrusive interstitials impact on user experience\n\nHow likely users are to engage with intrusive interstitials\n\n60 Percent of Users Would Leave Due to Intrusive Interstitials\n\nIf you were shopping and an interstitial pop-up appeared on the site you were shopping on, would you leave the site?\n\n60 percent of our survey respondents said \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nFor 35 to 44-year-olds, this number was 62.28 percent. Something to keep in mind if your target demographic falls in this age range.\n\n40 percent said they would stay on the site despite being served an intrusive interstitial.\n\nEven impulsive shoppers \u2014 the 14.5 percent of respondents who said they\u2019d make a purchase on their first visit to a site \u2014 can be dissuaded by interstitials. 52 percent said they would leave the site.\n\nUsers Say Pop-ups Are Spammy or Distracting\n\nSo what\u2019s the biggest reason users say they would leave a site after being served an interstitial pop -up?\n\n33 percent said the site feels too spammy.\n\n22 percent said they don\u2019t want to be sold anything other than what they are looking for.\n\nAnd another 22 percent felt the site owner is being obstructive to their experience.\n\nWhat We Learned From Our Data\n\nRegardless of their feelings on interstitial pop-ups, most of our survey respondents would likely engage with these pop-ups if the timing and benefit was right.\n\n86 percent said they are likely to sign up or add their email while shopping in order to get discounts.\n\nEven those who are thrown off by intrusive interstitials are still very discount motivated.\n\nWith this observation, maybe there is a place for pop-ups to collect emails. But they should follow Google\u2019s guidelines, and potentially be a bit later in the shopping experience.\n\nYour audience also wants to feel like they are getting something out of their shopping experience. Giving away their email to needs to be worth the potential \u201cspam\u201d later on.\n\nIf you notice that your user is spending about 3 minutes on a page, try adding an interstitial pop-up at 1.5 minutes and offer a discount with email sign up. The timing will feel less intrusive to the initial shopping experience AND the user will feel they are benefiting from taking the desired action.\n\nIt\u2019s worth A/B testing interstitial pop-ups on your site to see what the engagement rate and conversions are with different timing and offers.\n\nStrategic use of pop-ups on certain pages can lead to lucrative results.\n\nFor example, the quiz pop-up on my website requires users to enter their email to get their quiz results. This quiz section alone has helped me generate over $3 million dollars in revenue.\n\nFor reference, the data below just covers my small business division in the US. If we expand this to global operations and enterprise clients, the quiz is even more effective!\n\nTest and see what your audience really wants so you can start raking in big benefits.\n\nThe Best Way to Use Intrusive Interstitials\n\nThe priority with interstitial pop-ups is to make sure they don\u2019t interrupt the user experience.\n\nTo get the best use of an interstitial pop-up you\u2019ve got to make sure it\u2019s effective.\n\nOne effective approach is to use timed pop-ups that appear after the user has spent some time on the website. This will indicate that they\u2019re engaged and interested in the content.\n\nAnother way is to make sure the pop-up design is clean, visually appealing, and easy to close.\n\nYou can also offer an incentive or benefit for users who sign up or provide their information. This would be a good time to reel them in with a discount code or exclusive content.\n\nRemember, the key is to use interstitial pop-ups in a way that adds value to the user experience, rather than detracting from it.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is an intrusive interstitial? An intrusive interstitial is a type of pop-up or advertisement that appears on a website during the user\u2019s session. It usually covers a significant portion of the content, requiring the user to interact with it before they can access the content they were trying to view. What are some examples of intrusive interstitials? The following are some examples of intrusive interstitials:\n\nCookie policies\n\nAge verifications\n\nEmail list sign up What do interstitials mean for SEO? You can use interstitial pop-ups to highlight your offering with relevant keywords for users, encouraging them to engage. However, be careful with how you go about this. Interstitial pop-up SEO can be negatively impacted because they can disrupt the user experience, leading to a higher bounce rate and lower search engine rankings. Does Google penalize sites with intrusive interstitials? Yes, but it\u2019s a certain format that Google docks you for. In 2017, Google rolled out an update to its mobile search algorithm that penalizes websites that use intrusive interstitials. The penalty is applied to sites that display intrusive interstitials that make content less accessible or harder to access like full-screen pop-ups or interstitials that must be dismissed before accessing the main content. How effective are interstitials? Interstitials can be effective in certain contexts. Think about when you promote relevant and valuable content or products to users. The effectiveness of interstitials largely depends on their design, placement, and targeting. If you\u2019re going to interrupt a user\u2019s flow, make sure there\u2019s a high value add for them. What are the benefits of interstitials (if any)? Intrusive interstitials can offer several benefits to your site, including:\n\nIncreased visibility: Interstitials grab users\u2019 attention and increase visibility for important content or promotions. Use time-sensitive promotions or announcements that need to be communicated to users quickly.\n\nImproved engagement: Well-designed interstitials that offer value to users, such as personalized recommendations or exclusive content, can improve engagement and encourage users to spend more time on your site.\n\nEnhanced targeting: Target specific user groups based on their demographics, behavior, or preferences. This allows marketers to deliver more relevant and personalized messages that are more likely to resonate with users.\n\nHigher conversion rates: When used strategically and in moderation, you can get higher conversion rates for products, services, or other desired actions. Use an interstitial pop-up next time to promote special offers or discounts that encourage users to make a purchase.\n\nMonetization opportunities: Use interstitials to display advertisements and generate revenue. While it\u2019s important to balance advertising with a positive user experience, an interstitial pop-up can offer a way to monetize content and generate revenue from users who might otherwise use ad-blockers.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s not a crime to use intrusive interstitials.\n\nA little interstitial pop-up never hurt anybody. You just need to make sure it adds value.\n\nRemember to make your pop-up effective and not spammy because that\u2019s what turns visitors away.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use one, make sure you add benefits for visitors to take away like a discount code.\n\nThe data we gathered and Google\u2019s guidelines show you exactly how to win over visitors.\n\nWith careful timing and design, marketers can still use pop-ups to capture user information and engage with customers without causing frustration.\n\nSo, it\u2019s important to be mindful of how you use interstitial pop-ups.\n\nDon\u2019t let the desire for increased engagement and user information harm your user experience.\n\nFollowing tips from our data, you can still achieve your goals without driving users away.\n\nDo you find intrusive interstitials helpful or annoying when browsing websites?\n\nSee How My Agency Can Drive More Traffic to Your Website SEO - unlock more SEO traffic.

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here .\n\n7 Marketing Stats That Changed the Way I Think About Marketing\n\nI\u2019ve been a marketer for over 20 years. And over time, you kind of get stuck in your ways\u2026\n\nEspecially when you have done something a specific way for years and it works, it\u2019s hard to change your ways.\n\nBut I\u2019ve tried to remain open-minded over the years\u2026 and these stats have helped me change my ways.\n\nStat #1: Omni-channel marketing boosts revenue on all channels\n\nYears ago (pre-covid) I was in Toronto sitting in Expedia\u2019s Canada office. I was with my buddy Tony, and we were going over campaign stats.\n\nAnd he broke down an interesting test that they ran at Expedia. See, Expedia owns a lot of properties such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Trip Advisor (they spun it out), Travelocity, etc\u2026\n\nOne thing in common with all the Expedia brands is they are already well-known and good size companies. Plus, they all have been around for many years, so if you ask anyone who travels or books flights or hotels, chances are they are familiar with the Expedia brand.\n\nBut Tony mentioned something interesting\u2026 even though Expedia is a well-known brand, they found that when they leverage omnichannel marketing and don\u2019t just rely on a few channels, they\u2019ve noticed that all their marketing channels performed better by roughly 10%.\n\nOnce I learned this, I started to put this into action. And not just on one site, but on many sites, with revenues of all different sizes.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this for years now on dozens of sites that I consult with and here are the results.\n\nThe big thing I learned is omnichannel marketing helped all channels perform better. But what\u2019s interesting is the results were better for smaller brands and companies versus larger ones.\n\nStat #2: Your number one keyword should be your brand\n\nCheck this table out, it shows the top 10 most searched queries on Google.\n\nNotice a pattern?\n\n70% of the top 10 most searched keywords are brands.\n\nOnce I saw this, I decided to do something that was fun. I looked at all the companies we worked with that generate over 1 billion dollars annual revenue and I wanted to see what percentage of their search traffic comes from their brand.\n\nAnd then I did the same for companies that generate $100 million to $999 million in revenue. And I did the same for companies will $10 million to $99 million in revenue and $1 million to $9 million.\n\nIn general, the bigger the company the more of their search traffic comes from their brand.\n\nSure, SEO is important, and so is paid ads, social media, and other marketing channels too\u2026 but you need to focus on branding if you want to win in the long run.\n\nThe main 2 ways you do that are:\n\nYou stay in business for a long time. You build a good product or service that people love.\n\nNow the 3rd way you do that is through the rule of 7. In which one someone sees your brand and interacts with it 7 times they are much more likely to evangelize it and become a loyal follower.\n\nThis reinforces that you need to:\n\nTake an omnichannel approach to increase the odds that someone continually sees your brand. Focus a portion of your marketing on branding. Not all marketing needs to have a direct or immediate ROI.\n\nStat #3: Launches work\n\nYou know those marketers that tell you that they can make you rich, and all you have to do is buy their course or ebook and your life will change?\n\nI was in Austin years ago and I was eating dinner with a friend, who taught me an interesting marketing lesson.\n\nTake the marketing tactics from aggressive marketers that are promoting things that aren\u2019t so ethical, and apply them to legitimate businesses.\n\nOne of those things that a lot of these aggressive marketers use is launches.\n\nMany of them supposedly \u201cgenerated\u201d over $1 million in 24 hours by launching a product through email marketing.\n\nIn essence, they promote a product hard right before they are ready to sell it, as well as the day their product opens up for people to buy, and throughout the first week that their product is on the market.\n\nSo, I tried it out with my NeilPatel.com list.\n\nDo you want to guess the sales I generated in the first week?\n\nA whopping $756,954 (before refunds).\n\nI didn\u2019t hit a million bucks, but still not bad. It was through a series of emails such as this one.\n\nBack then my email list size was much smaller too. That email went out to 255,237 people while my current list size is 1.4 million people.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not the only one who does launches. So does Apple and many other large companies.\n\nJust check out this video from one of Apple\u2019s launches.\n\nStat #4: The best country to market in is all countries\n\nEvery time I speak at conferences overseas people always talk about entering the U.S. market. Or how they want to focus on it because that\u2019s where the money is.\n\nIt\u2019s the furthest thing from the truth.\n\nI used to think the same way when I was younger, but I quickly learned working with large corporations that the money is not in the U.S., it\u2019s in the whole world.\n\nYes, the U.S. is a massive market and usually the biggest market for many companies when you look at it from a revenue standpoint, but the U.S. makes up a fraction of the revenue for most large companies that generate over a billion dollars in revenue.\n\nCheck this chart out that shows Apple\u2019s revenue by region:\n\nThis means you need to focus on globalization with your marketing.\n\nSure one country may not be as big as you want, but when you add them all up, it really makes a big difference.\n\nJust look at my traffic breakdown per region:\n\nEven with my ad agency we are now in 16 countries (they are not all announced) and we will be in 20 countries by the end of the year and my goal by the end of next year is to be in 35 countries.\n\nEven though the economy is bad, when I compare our year-to-date revenue growth in international markets, we are up 61%.\n\nThat\u2019s crazy growth. Especially in this economy.\n\nApple, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, Adobe, BMW, Toyota, P&G, Coca-Cola, etc\u2026 they are all global companies. So, focus your marketing efforts globally and not just domestically.\n\nThis article should help you with your globalization. Or you can just hit up my ad agency and we can help.\n\nStat #5: Just because a company has money, doesn\u2019t mean it can spend it\n\nIf you ever tried to market in the B2B realm, you may notice longer sales cycles and fewer companies to market to than consumer-based businesses.\n\nEven with that, B2B is a lucrative market. Businesses have more money to spend than consumers.\n\nBut just because they can spend money, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for employees within a company to do so.\n\nAnd to see how much that applies to my industry, marketing, I did a survey asking 2824 marketers that work for companies back in 2021 if they need approval from their boss before they can spend money on anything related to marketing (no matter what the dollar amount was).\n\nOnce I realized that budget approvals are a roadblock, or at least they can slow things down, I started to test out a lot of \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cfreemium\u201d marketing methods.\n\nJust look at what we did with Ubersuggest. You can do tons with the software for free.\n\nWhy do we do that? It\u2019s because if you work for a company like Nike as an employee and need help with your paid ads or SEO, it\u2019s tough to get budget approval. So it\u2019s easier to use a free tool.\n\nNow my agency, NP Digital, offers services. But can you guess how many of our customers come from Ubersuggest?\n\nA whopping 41% the last time we checked.\n\nEven though a lot of our customers are enterprise companies, and Ubersuggest has over 2 million users (mainly small businesses)\u2026 a small percentage of those users are enterprise companies which really adds up.\n\nIf you want to appeal to the B2B market, just remember people have to get approval to spend money. So, the trojan horse is to offer something for free, build the relationship, and the moment their budgets open up you will be top of mind.\n\nStat #6: There is no perfect marketing channel\n\nI used to be a big advocate of SEO\u2026 and just SEO.\n\nI used to believe it was the best channel because in the long run, it\u2019s cheaper than paid ads.\n\nPlus, if you stop your paid ads, you don\u2019t get any more traffic.\n\nAnd with social media, it\u2019s much tougher to get clicks over to your website than SEO.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean SEO is the best channel. Now I still love SEO, but I actually love all marketing channels and I push all of them instead of \u201conly\u201d pushing SEO.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nEven though a lot of businesses fail, as you can see from the chart above, overall more people are creating businesses. The more businesses that are out there, the more competition you\u2019ll have when it comes to marketing.\n\nWe are all fighting for the same attention.\n\nSo no matter what marketing channel you are leveraging it will eventually become competitive. In marketing, we call it the law of shitty click-throughs.\n\nIn 1994 the HotWired banner ad CTR was 78%.\n\nIn 2011 Facebook\u2019s CTR was .05%.\n\nEmail open rates have also declined over time.\n\nAnd the same goes with remarketing ads and pretty much most marketing channels.\n\nNow this doesn\u2019t mean marketing is dead, it just means it is competitive. And the best way to succeed is to leverage all the channels and use them for what they are worth.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can scale a channel up to millions a month or only thousands a month, as long as a channel is profitable why not leverage it?\n\nStat #7: It\u2019s better to focus your marketing than go broad\n\nHave you ever been at a dinner table and no one has ever heard of the company you work for? Or know what industry you are in?\n\nIt\u2019s funny because to this date I still meet companies who have a goal of having more people know about their brand.\n\nAnd these aren\u2019t small companies either. Have you ever heard of: Corning, Centene, AmerisourceBergen, or Archer Daniels Midland?\n\nThese are all large companies. Just look at AmerisourceBergen. It\u2019s a Fortune 100 company\u2026 but most people have no clue what it is or what they do.\n\nBut check this stat out. According to the founder of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, it takes a minimum of 10 years to build a widely-recognizable brand. It doesn\u2019t matter what industry you are in, that\u2019s a long time.\n\nSo, focusing broadly on random buyers is just going to slow you down.\n\nJust the other day, my podcasting co-host asked me to share this video about boats on Instagram.\n\nI didn\u2019t\u2026 On TikTok it got over a million views. It would do even better if I shared it.\n\nBut can you guess why I didn\u2019t share it?\n\nTalking about boats and yachts may be cool, but it isn\u2019t going to bring in any customers. It\u2019s just a waste of time.\n\nNow to defend my co-host, he did tie marketing into the podcast episode so there was a purpose of him talking about yachts\u2026 I just know that if you want to do well in marketing it doesn\u2019t matter if you have tons of views or followers, it\u2019s the right audience that matters.\n\nAnd I\u2019m speaking from experience\u2026 I have over 1 million Facebook followers and over 1 million YouTube followers. But that\u2019s just a number, it doesn\u2019t matter so much.\n\nTrying to be popular or having everyone know your brand doesn\u2019t matter. Focus on your ideal buyers. Focusing on everyone convolutes your message and just causes you to waste marketing dollars.\n\nJust look at toothpaste. We all use it\u2026 but just because we all use it doesn\u2019t mean toothpaste companies just blanketly target all of us with the same messaging or even products.\n\nInstead, they focus on their ideal customer based on the product they created within that category.\n\nThey do that because improves their ROI.\n\nConclusion\n\nMarketing is constantly changing, so you must have an open mind.\n\nJust because people do something a certain way doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was much more stuck in my ways and it hurt my growth (both personally and from a business standpoint).\n\nBut now I continually look to test and experiment and try things that are against the grain.\n\nWhat other marketing stats have changed the way you think?\n\nSee How My Agency Can Drive More Traffic to Your Website SEO - unlock more SEO traffic.

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here .\n\n11 Tips For Creating a More Effective Case Study (With Examples)\n\nAre you using case studies to promote your business? If you\u2019re not, it\u2019s a good idea to consider including them in your content marketing.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause case studies are a powerful tool to increase sales and drive conversions.\n\nThey provide real-life examples of how your brand helps customers reach their goals.\n\nAn in-depth case study highlights your successes and allows you to show rather than tell prospective customers how you can help them reach their goals.\n\nHowever, writing a solid case study can be a challenge. Many examples I see online are bland, thin, and don\u2019t deliver the value they could.\n\nIt\u2019s time to change that. In this article, I detail 11 actionable tips explaining how to write a case study.\n\nLet\u2019s get started with tip number one.\n\n1. Write About Someone Your Ideal Customer Will Relate To\n\nDo you know who your ideal customer is? If it\u2019s someone in the education industry, make case studies about your university customers. If it\u2019s someone in the automobile industry, make your case studies about auto parts and accessories manufacturers. Whatever niche you\u2019re in, case studies give you the perfect way to reach your target market.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that your case study shows prospective customers that you are:\n\ncomfortable in their industry\n\nunderstand their industry\u2019s specific needs\n\nknow how to give their industry targeted results\n\nThink about it on a smaller level, such as when you\u2019re reading a how-to blog post \u2014 most posts are geared toward average readers.\n\nHowever, when you see a post explicitly designed for your needs (such as online marketing for the healthcare industry), you are more likely to understand and apply the information.\n\nThe same is true with case studies \u2013 people who read about results in their industry can see the possibilities. Writing case studies also positions you as an expert in your sector, helping to boost your authority and give consumers confidence.\n\n2. Tell the Story from Start to Finish\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced and competitive world, storytelling matters. Telling a memorable story as a content writer sets you apart and positions you as the go-to expert in your industry.\n\nStorytelling is the most powerful way to breathe life into your content and brand. It\u2019s the art of communicating an event, project, or experience in an interesting and relatable manner.\n\nIn a nutshell, it\u2019s about time you tap into the power of storytelling if you want your readers to really know your customers.\n\nWhen you\u2019re considering writing a case study, look at:\n\nWho is the sample customer, and what do they do?\n\nWhat were the customer\u2019s goals?\n\nWhat were the customer\u2019s needs?\n\nHow did you satisfy those needs and help customers meet their goals?\n\nThen, apply the same rules as you would with any other form of storytelling by including a beginning, a middle, and an end.\n\nInteresting Beginning\n\nThe image below shows how Nick Francis from HelpScout started his story with a strong line. You have to keep reading after such a captivating beginning.\n\nExpository Middle\n\nRemember that this is the meat of your story \u2013 the main body. It must resonate with people. Here are some tips to help you achieve that:\n\nUse persuasive words, encouraging people to act.\n\nLay out your thoughts and advice clearly by using bulleted points.\n\nInclude interactive videos to make your story truly engaging.\n\nGo straight to the point; avoid needless words.\n\nOutline the results your existing clients and students achieved by working with you.\n\nFor inspiration on the above, look at the NP digital case study library.\n\nAction-Oriented Conclusion\n\nMake your conclusion action-oriented. In other words, tell your prospects what to do next and how to do it.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t bore readers and potential clients after you\u2019ve persuaded them with a high-quality expository middle.\n\nRemember to include a course of action in every phase of your client acquisition process. Otherwise, you\u2019ll lose out on motivated clients.\n\nWhen concluding your story-based case study, you can ask simple interview questions to avoid being sales-y or pushy.\n\nLater, you can follow up with the customer in the case study and update it to show how your clients continue to reap the benefits.\n\nFinally, highlight emotional benefits and hard numbers. Did your solution improve morale, increase employee retention, or allow workers to focus on less tedious tasks?\n\nThis allows readers to see that your goal is to help with immediate needs and to deliver long-term results.\n\n3. Structure Your Case Study to Persuade\n\nWriting a case study only builds credibility if you know how to structure it. Don\u2019t forget there are a gazillion case studies out there that no one cares about.\n\nHow do you write a case study that gets noticed above the noise? You need the power to persuade. Think Robert Collier, David Ogilvy, and Gary Halbert.\n\nThese copywriters are still talked about today, and they all know how to create persuasive copy by:\n\nUsing emotional language to connect with an audience\n\nFocusing on the benefits of a product or service and not just the features\n\nHighlighting your audience\u2019s pain points and positioning your product/service as the solution\n\nIncluding testimonials, or social proof as we most often refer to it today\n\nYou can apply these same steps to writing a case study that resonates with your audience. However, there are other approaches you could take, like telling the story from the perspective of a happy customer.\n\nCase Study Outline Example\n\nHere\u2019s an example outline for a case study:\n\nIntroduction: Start with a brief overview of the problem your customer faced. Include a background of the company and the product/service you used to help resolve their issues.\n\nThe Challenge: Clearly define the challenge or issue that led to the case study. This should include the impact, scope, and duration of the problem.\n\nThe Solution: Next, explain the solution or strategy you implemented to address the challenge. Include the unique approach, resources, and other vital details.\n\nThe Implementation: This section should cover how your company executed the solution, including timelines, roles and responsibilities of team members, and other details about the implementation process.\n\nThe Results: Highlight the outcomes of the strategy, including the specific impact on customer satisfaction ratings, customer retention, and other metrics. Use graphs and charts to showcase the results.\n\nConclusion: Finally, conclude with a recap of the problem, the solution adopted, and the results achieved. Also, include any additional insights, learnings, and recommendations for future improvements.\n\nReferences: Include references or sources that support the case study. This ensures credibility and can help readers further understand the solution and outcomes presented in the case study. For instance, include a screenshot of the increased conversions and quotes from your client.\n\n4. Make Your Case Study Easy to Read\n\nNo one wants to read one huge chunk of text, no matter how interesting and informative it might be. Case studies, like blog posts, should be scannable and easy to read.\n\nBe sure to use good content formatting elements as you would with articles, blog posts, and copywriting on your website, including:\n\nheaders\n\nimages\n\nbulleted lists\n\nbold or italicized text\n\nIn addition to providing excellent SEO value for your case studies page, these formatting elements will help your readers (especially those that like to skim) find the most important parts of your case study and understand the value you deliver.\n\nConsider adding multimedia elements in addition to written content, such as videos, PDFs, and images, to mix it up and make the content more engaging.\n\nImages of the actual customer results dashboards, and even video interviews make your case study easier to read and more compelling.\n\nAlso:\n\nInclude a clear introduction that offers context and outlines the main problem or challenges your case study covers. Use quotes and testimonials from customers or clients to add credibility and make the case study more relatable. Include a conclusion or summary that ties everything together and highlights the key takeaways.\n\nAnother way to produce case studies is with before and after images. We\u2019ll look at an example next.\n\n5. Provide Clear \u201cBefore and After\u201d Examples\n\nFitness experts tend to use this strategy most effectively. You\u2019ve all seen the \u201cBefore and After\u201d example images of people who have lost a dramatic amount of weight.\n\nWhen people want to lose weight or build muscle, purchasing any product or program often depends on the \u201cbefore and after\u201d images. Take a look at this example from Fit Father Project:\n\nThese case studies work well because they show what\u2019s possible and what the program can help you achieve. There are few better ways to advertise a fitness business.\n\nHowever, even as an internet marketer, you can still use the \u201cbefore and after\u201d when writing a case study.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to understand that when prospective clients are seriously looking for the best solution or service provider to hire, they don\u2019t want to hear or see anything except the results.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to highlight product features and benefits. That can help, but the real motivation usually comes from measurable results.\n\nIn your case study, you can showcase your clients\u2019 challenges before they began using your product.\n\nShowing the transition from before to after that product, strategy, or approach can persuade clients to hire you more than any other tactic.\n\nI always do this when I host a live webinar or write a post, and you can do this when writing a case study, too.\n\n6. Include Real Numbers\n\nHave you ever read case studies where a business states they \u201cdoubled traffic\u201d for the customer in their case study and wondered if that meant they went from 100 to 200 visits or 10,000 to 20,000 visits?\n\nWhen writing a case study, you need to be specific. Share exactly how much your increased traffic, revenue, or whatever goals matter to your customers. Put the numbers out there. Including this data makes your case study more believable and helps build trust in your brand.\n\nInstead of saying you doubled their traffic, provide specific, accurate numbers and (if possible) actual proof through charts, graphs, or analytics data.\n\nRemember that only some people are as familiar with analytics technology as you are, so highlight the most important pieces of data and provide context as to why it matters.\n\nHere\u2019s an example from Page One:\n\nThis way, the reader can see where the customer began and where the customer ended up with your help.\n\nPlus, having the picture proof can help the reader envision exactly what you might do for them, making your case study that much more powerful.\n\n7. Talk About Specific Strategies in Your Case Study\n\nYou\u2019ve doubled a website\u2019s traffic or sales, right? How did you do it? This is where you sell your products or services simply by saying which ones you used and how they led to the desired result.\n\nDon\u2019t just say, \u201cour online marketing services led to these results.\u201d Instead, say something like, \u201d A three-month social media campaign focusing on Facebook and YouTube and a five-month link-building campaign led to an increase in rankings and an increase in traffic from 2,000 to 15,000 per month.\u201d\n\nConsider including metrics and data to support the campaign\u2019s success, such as click-through rates, conversions, or engagement metrics. This helps to back up your claims and establish credibility with potential clients or customers.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about giving away your secrets \u2014 the goal is to establish your brand as an industry leader, and you need to show you know your stuff.\n\n8. Test Different Content Formats\n\nWriting a case study doesn\u2019t have to follow the typical format. Try different types of case studies, such as video testimonials, where you have your clients answer questions about what they do, their needs, their goals, and how you met them.\n\nQuoting your customer in their own words makes the case study even more relatable to your ideal customer than you telling the story.\n\nInfographics, webinars, testimonials, and even podcasts can also be used to highlight case studies. Don\u2019t get stuck in the same old text-only format \u2014 get creative and see what type of content your users respond to.\n\nHere\u2019s a case study example from Venngage that uses a brochure-style case study to highlight how Vortex grew conversion. (Notice the results section that highlights specific gains).\n\n9. Find the Right Competitor to Profile in Your Case Study\n\nWho are your competitors, and what results did they achieve? Profiling your competitor in your case study analysis is a great way to show how your product works.\n\nNot sure how to get started? Check out our step-by-step guide below.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s find your competitors, in case you don\u2019t know yet who they are.\n\ni). First step: Go to Semrush.com. Enter your blog URL (e.g., neilpatel.com) into the search box. Then, click on the \u201csearch\u201d button.\n\nii). Second step: Analyze your competitors. Scroll down through the results, and you\u2019ll see your \u201cMain Organic Competitors\u201d:\n\niii). Third step: Research your competitors. From the list of your main organic competitors, you can pick one of them to research.\n\nVisit their website and read a couple of posts. Look for experiments, split tests, case studies, client testimonials, interview questions, etc.\n\nThen, leverage that data in your case study.\n\nIn the client\u2019s mind, since a brand offers the same service or sells the same product and it worked, your own offer may also work \u2013 all things being equal.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a software marketer who just started out, you probably don\u2019t have much data or any compelling success stories yet.\n\nHowever, you can profile other SaaS marketers. You could share the results that Pat Flynn\u2019s clients got or profile Derek Halpern and his students.\n\nHere\u2019s a recent case study where I profiled some of my competitors. I shared how these competitors increased their email open rates.\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to showcase data from your core competitors as part of your custom paper.\n\nIf you see a brand that\u2019s doing great and making a real impact, you can share its journey and revenue (assuming you have access to it).\n\nWay back in February 2016, Pat Flynn generated over $65,000. You could share a case study on your blog to inspire clients on what\u2019s obtainable.\n\nYour titles could be similar to these:\n\nCase Study: How Pat Flynn Generated Over $65,000 in February [3-Step Process]\n\n7 Steps to Making Over $100,000 From Blogging [Must Read for B2B Marketers]\n\nNot too long ago, I profiled Shopify and shared how the online shopping cart company grew 10x in 3 years.\n\nIs there a benefit of this case study, seeing that it\u2019s not directly related to my blog or the results from my clients?\n\nWell, take a look at the title again. See the underlined section. That\u2019s what matters to any client.\n\nWhen showcasing the results from competitors or other brands, find a way to provide value.\n\nHelp the reader see the possibility of getting similar or even better results. You could showcase results from competitors and use those as a benchmark for your own performance.\n\nShowcasing competitors\u2019 results also gives you the opportunity to create content highlighting your brand\u2019s unique value proposition or competitive advantages. This can help to differentiate your brand from the competition and make it more appealing to potential customers or clients.\n\n10. Appeal to Different Types of Learners\n\nWhile some people enjoy reading, others may prefer audio, video, or visual representation of your case study; consider taking your text-based case studies and re-purposing the content as:\n\nA podcast\n\nA YouTube video\n\nAn engaging infographic (Hubspot has a list of 20 to inspire you).\n\nThe bonus of YouTube videos and infographics is that they are easy to share. Your case study could go beyond your site, helping more potential customers discover the benefits of your products/services.\n\nYou could also embed your case studies into other types of content \u2014 such as an ebook, how-to blog post, or resource guide. Additionally, you might link to your case study from other posts to prove your value, mention it in a webinar, or include numbers in a presentation.\n\n11. Make Your Case Studies Easy to Find\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of writing a case study if no one reads it? For easy discoverability, keep your case studies organized and easy to find. This means listing them on your website, optimizing them for search, and promoting them in email and social media.\n\nHere are a few case study examples that are easy to find \u2014 and, therefore, much more powerful.\n\nAmazon Web Services\n\nAmazon Web Services provides case studies from multiple niches. AWS also makes it easy to look for industry-specific case studies.\n\nAWS mixes it up with podcasts, videos, and other media types.\n\nWhat AWS also does well is detail specifics, as we suggested earlier. For instance, in a case study for its client Silverblaze, AWS highlights the 66 percent reduction in annual infrastructure costs.\n\nDrupal\n\nDrupal provides case studies right on its homepage. Users considering using the solution don\u2019t have to look far to see how other brands are succeeding with Drupal.\n\nQuick Checklist: 11 Steps to Create a Better Case Study\n\nWriting an in-depth case study helps highlight your successes and turn prospects into customers. Here\u2019s how to make them more effective.\n\nMake it relatable. Highlight a customer similar to your ideal customer so they can relate to the results. Tell the whole story from start to finish. That means including a beginning, middle, and end and using storytelling. Don\u2019t just tell how you helped a week out \u2014 carry the story through and show how your product or service delivered value weeks or months down the line. Structure your case study to persuade. Make it easy to read. Your case study should be detailed, but don\u2019t make it dissertation-level. Use clear formatting and casual language. Provide before and after case study examples. . Include numbers: Storytelling is valuable, but so is proof. Use precise numbers to prove your value. Get specific about strategies. If you helped a client double their traffic, discuss how you did it. Did you up their content production, increase on-page SEO, etc. Find the right kind of competitor to profile in your case study. Look for competitors in your niche and profile them. Detail their results and let readers know what\u2019s possible. Use different formats: Case studies don\u2019t have to be in blog form! Consider videos, infographics, webinars, or even podcasts. Appeal to different learners: Some people respond to different kinds of content. Consider including multiple elements, such as an infographic in a blog post, to appeal to all types of learners. Make your case studies easy to find: Highlight them on your website, optimize them, and promote them on social media.\n\nCase Study FAQs\n\nWhat makes a good case study? A good case study focuses on the customer\u2019s experience and how they benefited from using a product or service.

If you want my team to just do your marketing for you, click here .\n\nWhat is Answer the Public?\n\nWhat is Answer the Public?\n\nIt\u2019s a question my team and I are asked a lot, especially after we acquired it last year.\n\nMy answer? If you\u2019re looking for content suggestion ideas and an easy way to see what questions people are asking online, it\u2019s an indispensable tool.\n\nWhether you want blog post ideas or to increase your chances of grabbing a featured snippet, Answer the Public is an amazing online market research tool to have in your back pocket.\n\nLike all marketing tools, you get out what you put in. By understanding the intent behind the data Answer the Public provides, you can provide content that targets your core audience.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what Answer the Public is, and how it can help you grow your business.\n\nHow Does Answer the Public Work?\n\nAnswer the Public uses autosuggest (also known as autocomplete) data to power its searches.\n\nWhat is autosuggest? If you\u2019ve ever started typing a keyword or search into Google, Google will bring up suggestions for things other people have been searching for.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for \u2018BBQ sauce recipes\u2019 on Google. You start typing the phrase, and Google suggests some ideas to provide additional context to your search.\n\nIn this case, terms including:\n\n\u2018BBQ sauce recipes for ribs\u2019\n\n\u2018BBQ sauce recipes for brisket\u2019\n\n\u2018BBQ sauce recipes from scratch\u2019\n\nAnswer the Public takes all the different autocomplete suggestions that could appear for your initial search term, known as a \u2018seed keyword.\u2019\n\nWhile you could do this yourself on Google, it would take several hours, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to capture every suggestion. In contrast, Answer the Public neatly collates this data for you in less than ten seconds!\n\nAnswer the Public presents the data in an understandable format, which you can use to listen in to what people are talking about online.\n\nThe capabilities of Answer the Public don\u2019t end there, though. Here\u2019s a look at some of the additional information that you can pull using this wonderful tool:\n\nCost-per-click data: This data reveals the average amount that advertisers are willing to pay for each click on their ads targeting specific keywords. By understanding the cost-per-click, you can gain insights into the competitiveness of keywords and estimate the potential value of targeting them in your advertising campaigns.\n\nSuggestion comparisons: Answer The Public also allows you to compare suggestions, which is an incredibly valuable feature. It presents you with different variations and related keywords based on the original search query you input. This feature is fantastic for expanding your keyword research, discovering new content ideas, or exploring alternative ways to optimize your content and pages.\n\nSearch listening and email alerts: With these options, Answer The Public continuously monitors the web for mentions of your chosen keywords or phrases, providing you with real-time insights into what people are saying or searching for. This feature helps you stay on top of industry trends, track your brand\u2019s online reputation, and even find new business opportunities. Not to mention, you can set up email alerts to receive regular updates on the latest findings, ensuring you never miss out on important information.\n\nHigh-resolution images: This feature comes in handy when you\u2019re creating visually appealing content or presentations and need access to quality visuals related to your search queries. It saves you time and effort by providing ready-to-use images that align with your topic or keyword.\n\nEducation/support: Need more specific guidance or help? Answer The Public offers an education package and priority customer support. The education package provides access to additional resources, training materials, and features that your marketing team can use. Additionally, priority customer support ensures that you get prompt assistance and guidance whenever you encounter any issues or have specific inquiries.\n\nHow to Leverage Answer the Public for Your Content\n\nThe thing I love most about Answer the Public is how easy it is to use. Enter your keyword, and you\u2019ll have a massive list of search terms to take advantage of.\n\nHowever, when you use it with the right keywords, you see the most benefit.\n\nHere are my top tips for getting the most out of Answer the Public, including how to use it to boost the chances of getting to the top of Google.\n\nUncovering Search Intent\n\nIt\u2019s essential not just to understand what people are searching for, but why they\u2019re searching.\n\nThis is called search intent, and it can help you customize Answer the Public content to meet your audience\u2019s needs.\n\nImagine you own a BBQ sauce company. Anna is searching for \u2018BBQ sauce recipes\u2019 while Betty is looking for \u2018best BBQ sauce to buy.\u2019\n\nWhich one is most likely to buy from your business?\n\nWell done if you said Betty. While Anna wants to make her own sauce, Betty is almost ready to purchase. All you need is the right content to gently nudge Betty towards your website.\n\nTypes of Search Intent\n\nThere are four different types of search intent:\n\nInformational. Someone is looking for information on a certain topic and is at the beginning stage of their buying journey (e.g. \u2018How to clean golf clubs\u2019) Navigational. Someone is searching specifically for your business or brand (e.g. \u2018Golfsupport blog\u2019) Commercial. Someone is researching a product or service before they buy (e.g. \u2018Cobra golf bag reviews\u2019) Transactional. Someone is actively looking to buy a product or service (e.g. buy Titleist golf hat\u2019)\n\nYou can use search intent to further power your results on Answer the Public. Take your keywords and sort them into four lists.\n\nWhich keywords and phrases align with people at the start of the buying journey, and which are being used by people ready to buy right now?\n\nYou can then create content that helps prospective customers wherever they are in the sales funnel.\n\nConducting Keyword Research\n\nAnswer the Public is great for getting a list of keywords together for your SEO optimization strategy.\n\nYou can use Answer the Public to generate a huge list of long-tail keywords. Over half of buyers use search terms of three or more words, so these keywords are great places to start if you\u2019re looking for sales and conversions.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got your keywords, you can use my keyword research tool Ubersuggest to find additional data, including SEO difficulty. The lower the number, the better the chances of ranking on the first page of the search engines.\n\nIdentifying Content Gaps\n\nYour website must answer all the questions that your target audience has. Otherwise, they\u2019ll get fed up and take their business elsewhere.\n\nYou can use Answer the Public to identify content gaps. This gives you the steer needed to create fresh new content that encourages customers to stay on your website. Look at what keywords people are asking around your niche, and then map those words and phrases to the pages on your website.\n\nIf any keywords and questions can\u2019t be applied to the existing information on your site, you\u2019ve found a content gap.\n\nFocusing on Answer Boxes\n\nAnswer the Public isn\u2019t just a fantastic way to create content your customers love. You can use the data it provides to increase the chances of appearing at the very top of the Google search results.\n\nOften referred to as a featured snippet or result zero, an answer box is a piece of information that appears on the first page of Google above the first organic search result.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re asking, \u2018what temperature should I BBQ at?\u2019 The answer box summarizes the information that answers the query, alongside a link to the webpage if the user wants to know more.\n\nThe answer box takes up a lot of space on the first page of Google, making it prime real estate for any business that wants to be seen.\n\nThe average click-through rate of an answer box is 8.6% meaning that if you can reach pole position, you\u2019ve got a great chance of stealing organic traffic from your competitors.\n\nAnother bonus of claiming the answer box is that it is often used to answer voice search queries. With over half the US population using voice search at least once a day, this can be a fantastic way to open your business up to more prospective customers.\n\nHere\u2019s how to increase the chances of getting the answer box for your search term of choice, and how Answer the Public can help.\n\nAsk the Right Questions\n\nThe primary purpose of answer boxes is to provide fast and helpful responses to popular queries.\n\nThis means your content is more likely to feature as an answer box if it\u2019s in the form of a question.\n\nThink of the game show Jeopardy!, but in Google instead!\n\nThe brilliant thing about Answer the Public is that it automatically pulls together a list of questions people are asking about your seed keyword of choice.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to our BBQ sauce search. Answer the Public has an entire section where you can see what questions are popular with search engine users.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got a list of questions appropriate to your business, enter them into Google to see if there is an answer box. Alternatively, you can click on individual questions in the visualization (also known as a \u2018word cloud\u2019) to be taken straight to the relevant Google Search result.\n\nLet\u2019s take the question: \u2018what BBQ sauce is best for chicken?\u2019 This search doesn\u2019t have an answer box, meaning you\u2019ve got a good chance of appearing there if you optimize your content just right.\n\nIt might be that you\u2019ve already got the answer box for the relevant question \u2013 if so, mission accomplished!\n\nIf a competitor has the answer box, don\u2019t panic. You can easily steal the answer box away from them by providing information that offers readers more value.\n\nOptimize Content\n\nWhether you\u2019re creating brand new content or optimizing your existing web pages, there are ways you can increase the chances of landing that all-important answer box.\n\nUse bullet points, numbered lists, and tables to make your content easier to read\n\nMake your content concise and easy to understand \u2013 the average answer box is between 40 to 50 words\n\nUse headings or subheadings to structure your content, and use question keywords in your headings\n\nThe good news is that if you\u2019re already ranking on the first page of Google, you\u2019re more likely to be chosen for the answer box. According to Ahrefs, positions one, two, and three have a 70% chance of getting the answer box.\n\nRegularly check to see where you are in the search engine results. If you\u2019re still not appearing in the answer box, keep tweaking your content until you hit that sweet spot.\n\nInclude Media With Your Answers\n\nAnother way to boost the chances of owning an answer box is with high-quality images, photos, and videos. This provides additional context and offers extra value to search engine users.\n\nMedia can also appear in the answer box, enticing people to click through to your web pages. As a bonus, images and videos mean your answer box takes up even more space in the search engine results!\n\nIt\u2019s important that any media you use is unique, eye-catching, and helps answer any questions the searcher has. Data charts, visualizations, and infographics are all excellent choices.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to add contextual alt text to any images you use to provide Google with extra information about your media choices.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget FAQs\n\nA FAQ section on your page can be an excellent opportunity to get an answer box result. FAQ sections naturally lend themselves to short, punchy responses to questions, which the Google search algorithm loves.\n\nYou can use Answer the Public to identify the questions people are asking the most. Look at the orange dot next to each result. The darker the dot, the more popular the search term.\n\nUse the question as one of your FAQ subheaders and then answer the question succinctly within the first two sentences for optimum results. Using FAQ schema can also give Google additional context about your FAQ section, meaning it\u2019s more likely to be chosen for relevant search queries.\n\nAnalyzing Your Results\n\nIt\u2019s great having a keyword research and social listening tool that\u2019s simple to use, but you want the data it provides to be easy to understand too.\n\nAnswer the Public does both!\n\nYou can download your data as a CSV file, making copying, pasting, and sorting your information easy.\n\nThe word clouds make it easy to see all your keywords in one place, as well as which words and phrases people are talking about the most. You can also see which keywords relate to each other and can be used in similar keyword clusters.\n\nPlus, you can save your searches, letting you go back for new ideas whenever your copy needs a refresh.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat is Answer the Public? Answer the Public is a free social listening tool to see what keywords and phrases people use on search engines like Google and Bing.\n\nIt uses autosuggest to uncover this related information, providing additional data, including search popularity, search volume, and predicted cost-per-click.

And the open rate, which was already an unreliable success metric, has become even more so since Apple launched its Mail Privacy Protection feature in 2021.\n\nSeveral lesser-known metrics will shed more light on whether your email program is thriving, surviving or ready for resuscitation. Depending on your ESP and its built-in reporting, you can track these right in your dashboard.\n\nThe others will require some calculating and integration with other databases in your organization, or a third-party reporting tool can be very useful. But the extra effort will be worth your time and energy because you\u2019ll understand better what\u2019s going on.\n\n1. Conversion rate\n\nDepending on your ESP, this campaign-level metric might be reported in your dashboard. But even if you can view it there, take some time to calculate it on your own.\n\nWhy you should track it\n\nWhen reviewing your metrics holistically, this metric will help you calculate your per-email-campaign success. You can use it to compare the success rates of email campaigns that target different-priced items.\n\nHow to calculate it\n\nTake the number of conversions and divide it by the number of emails delivered (Note: Not the total number of emails sent).\n\nLet\u2019s say you sent 105 emails, and 100 were delivered. If 50 subscribers click on your website, and 25 of them convert, that works out to a 25% conversion rate.\n\nWhat to know\n\nHow you calculate conversion rate matters. Remember that Google Analytics uses landing page sessions to calculate conversions. Email marketers need to isolate email-related activity to find the actual conversion rate, which involves a larger number of metrics before customers get to the campaign\u2019s landing page on your website.\n\nIf we were to calculate the conversion rate based on sessions, it would be 50%. That might look more impressive, but it doesn\u2019t track back to your email. It\u2019s the same number of conversions, just spread out over a much smaller field of possibilities.\n\nConversion is just one facet of the total email journey. If you focus only on website activity, you\u2019re excluding engagement on other parts of the customer journey in which email plays a part. It could also lead you to optimize incorrectly or negate the impact of your email messages.\n\nThis reporting tool below showcases the different results for conversions, depending upon which calculation you use.\n\n2. Value of an email address\n\nThis represents the monetary value of each email address in your database based on revenue from email. It is a business metric, not a campaign-level measurement.\n\nWhy you should track it\n\nUnlike other metrics in this list, the value of an email address can help you make strategic and business decisions as well as campaign-level planning.\n\nHow to calculate it\n\nMultiply the life of an address by annual email revenue and divide by the average list size in a year. For example, if the average life on your list is 3 years, your annual revenue from email is $700,000, and your annual list size is 95,000, the equation would look like this: 3 X $700,000 /95000 = $22\n\nWhat to know\n\nThis metric illustrates why it\u2019s so important to grow your email database. Here are two insights you can draw from this:\n\nReliable success metric\n\nFor example, suppose you want to increase frequency to increase revenue from email but are concerned that you could end up increasing unsubscribes or spam complaints from disgruntled subscribers.\n\nWhile unsubs and spam complaints are one factor to consider, higher frequency can convert more subscribers to purchase, which in turn would increase revenue. Tracking email address value can reveal whether your subscribers respond with revenue or revolt.\n\nEvaluate acquisition expenses\n\nKnowing your email address value can guide your decisions on how much to spend on subscriber acquisition. The higher value, the more you can justify spending to attract higher-quality subscribers. If you don\u2019t know your subscriber value, you could end up wasting your acquisition budget.\n\nOne note: This formula is more effective for B2C email marketing, especially retail and ecommerce. For B2B brands, the classic lead-nurturing process can make the value harder to determine.\n\n3. Customer behavior beyond campaigns\n\nThis long-tail metric involves tracking campaign-level metrics beyond the immediate campaign time period. It helps you account for every bit of revenue from email and benefits your program in the long run.\n\nWhy you should track it\n\nBecause we usually have to move on so quickly to the next campaign, many marketers simply close out each campaign with a static report without going back a week or longer later. That\u2019s a mistake because you likely will see some activity. If you keep tracking campaigns until you see no more activity, you could go months before you stop seeing conversions.\n\nHow to track it\n\nCheck your campaign activity regularly until you see no more activity. Automate this process through your reporting dashboard if you can, or send a manual reminder.\n\nWhat to know\n\nMost campaign reporting ends way too soon. But we know that customers often retain and act on emails days or weeks after you have moved on to a new campaign. That\u2019s the long tail of email in action. Customers don\u2019t always stop clicking after the campaign ends.\n\nEmail\u2019s \u201cnudge effect\u201d explains this long-tail characteristic. Subscribers aren\u2019t always in the market when your email campaigns arrive. If they\u2019re engaged with your brand, they might keep your email in the inbox until they\u2019re ready. Seeing your email can be enough to spur them to click and convert.\n\nUp to 19% of consumers will save the email for later to take advantage of a discount, special offer or sale, DMA UK\u2019s 2021 Consumer Email Tracking found. Although that number has been receding in recent years, it still points to a measurable source of revenue from email.\n\nIf you stop tracking activity too soon, you could be under-attributing revenue from email. One of my clients found it was under-recording email revenue by 128% when it expanded its reporting period from 4 days to 3 months.\n\nRemember, the more revenue you can attribute to your email campaigns, the more budget you can request and justify to support your program.\n\n4. ROI\n\nReturn on investment proves the channel\u2019s value and financial success of your email program. It can help you gain more budget and resources. and helps you to gain more budget and resources.\n\nWhy you should track it\n\nEmail marketers historically are overworked and under-resourced. Part of it is our fault. We don\u2019t provide detailed reporting, including many of the metrics I present here, and we don\u2019t sing our own praises often enough. But ROI is one of email\u2019s greatest advantages, so we need to measure it, report it and make sure financial decision-makers in our company know about it.\n\nHow to calculate it\n\nSubtract campaign costs from total campaign revenue. Divide by costs and multiply by 100.\n\nWhat to know\n\nYou probably are familiar with the general benchmark ROI numbers, which range from $28 for every $1 spent to $44 or more. While those numbers are nice to know, it\u2019s more important that you know your own ROI.\n\nThis metric is one your C-suite executives are likely to understand. You can use it to build business cases for additional spending that can bring in more revenue, increase engagement or have a similar positive effect on your goals and objectives.\n\nYou do run the risk that your executives will be so happy with ROI as it is that they won\u2019t see the value in increasing spending. That\u2019s when you can use ROI to reveal missed opportunities that need budget funding to deliver.\n\n5. Open-reach, click-reach and conversion-reach\n\nThese engagement metrics measure how well you engage your audience between campaigns.\n\nWhy you should track it\n\nThese metrics measure how many unique subscribers have opened, clicked or converted on your email campaigns at least once in a certain period. They are invaluable for measuring the overall engagement of your email program.\n\nHow to calculate it\n\nChoose your activity (opens, clicks or conversions) and measure how many unique subscribers opened (for open-reach) or clicked (for click-reach) at least one email per month, quarter or year. For conversion-reach, you calculate how many unique subscribers converted in the chosen period.\n\nWhat to know\n\nBy using this metric, you can identify the total reach of your campaigns for that quarter. For these engagement metrics to be truly useful, they must correlate to conversions and revenue, such that increasing open-reach also increases revenue.\n\nEach of these metrics has value (even the open rate) when you use them to track trends \u2014 whether they\u2019re increasing or decreasing. Adding reach to the equation gives you more information than you would get from each of these activity-based metrics by themselves.\n\nA few minutes with a calculator \u2014 or, ideally, good data visualizations displayed right in your email marketing platform\u2019s dashboard (a girl can wish!) \u2014 can pinpoint your strengths, highlight your weaknesses and help you map out new ways to message your customers more effectively.\n\n6. Customer lifetime value (CLTV)\n\nThis business metric helps you focus on customer retention and customer experience (CX).\n\nWhy you should track it\n\nThis number is helpful as both a benchmark metric \u2014 is it trending up, down or stable, and how does it compare to lifetime values of other marketing channels? \u2014 and as an absolute number that represents the value a typical customer represents.\n\nHow to calculate it\n\nCalculate your average customer\u2019s yearly spend and multiply it by the average number of years your customers are active. You also can calculate it based on different life stages or segments, such as the average customer compared with loyal customers.\n\nWhat to know\n\nCLTV is a long-term business metric that represents value beyond a single campaign\u2019s average order value or revenue per email. After all, customers don\u2019t \u2014 or shouldn\u2019t \u2014 buy just once from your brand.\n\nWhile you can track it over time to learn whether customers are spending more or less with your brand, its greater value is as the foundation for building business cases showing email\u2019s contribution to company revenue or to support a request for additional funding for acquisition, automations that can make your email messages more effective and drive more sales, and so on.\n\n7. List growth\n\nThis metric measures whether and how your list has grown in a set period.\n\nWhy you should track it\n\nPerhaps you look at your total list number when you get ready to send a promotional campaign. You can see it right there in your dashboard: \u201cSending campaign to 500,000 recipients.\u201d\n\nOr you look at how many people received your message. But how long has it been since you analyzed whether your list is growing or shrinking?\n\nHow to calculate it\n\nCount both the number of opt-ins in a month, quarter or year and the number of addresses removed because of unsubscribes, spam complaints, bounces and inactivity.\n\nFor example, if you start Month A with a list of 100,000 addresses, and start Month B with a list of 110,000, you might assume your list grew 10%, or by 10,000 addresses. But if you removed 5,000 addresses for the reasons I listed previously, your list actually grew by 15,000 addresses or 15.8%.\n\nWhat to know\n\nIn my experience, most people either don\u2019t measure list growth or look at only the total list size occasionally. But you need to measure your exact growth so you can understand how well your acquisition efforts are working or whether you\u2019re losing more subscribers than you take in. You\u2019ll also understand better how much churn your list goes through in a year, which is important to know if you need to hit a list-growth goal.\n\nSuppose, for example, you need to increase your list by 20% for the year. If you have a list of 100,000 addresses, you might think you need to add 20,000 new email addresses. But you\u2019ll need more than that if you lose 5% of your list every month to churn. The chart below shows how churn affects list acquisition.\n\nKnowing how list growth fluctuates month to month will help you better understand how changes in decisions like frequency (how often you send messages) and cadence (the intervals between messages) affect frequency. The bottom line can obscure the finer details of both churn and acquisition.\n\nGo beyond your ESP\u2019s dashboard\n\nAlthough many ESPs now offer more detailed metrics, most still focus on email activity like opens, clicks and unsubscribes. A separate robust reporting tool that integrates across databases enables you to slice up your data in more relevant ways and understand what\u2019s really happening with your program. You can use this information to identify where you need to improve or where advanced services can help you drive more revenue.\n\nReporting tools like these give you another advantage \u2014 immediate access to your data. You might work with a terrific analytics team, but you probably have to compete with other marketing channels or departments for their time and attention.\n\nCustomized reports can be a long time coming, and you probably don\u2019t have the luxury of time to wait, especially with holiday marketing campaigns or annual goals and strategy to create.", "date": "2023-07-07"}, {"link": "https://martech.org/10-things-you-hate-about-google-analytics-4/", "title": "10 things you hate about Google Analytics 4", "content": "Google Analytics 4 hasn\u2019t exactly got off to the best start with marketers.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s getting pretty awkward \u2014 some advertisers are so disappointed with the new program that they\u2019ve even been hosting funerals for its predecessor, Universal Analytics.\n\nBut what is it about GA4 that\u2019s got the world of digital marketing so riled up?\n\nWe recently asked our readers in a GA4 readiness poll what problems they were facing. Here\u2019s a list of the most common complaints.\n\n1. User interface\n\nGA4\u2019s user interface was hands-down the biggest issue our readers reported. The UI was described as \u201cslow\u201d, \u201claughable\u201d and a few other adjectives we\u2019re opting not to publish.\n\nIndependent sales and marketing contractor, John Erikson, told us:\n\n\u201cWhen on selecting segments/dimensions in GA4, instead of the ability in Universal to select/deselect one or more segments in a single list and click \u2018apply\u2019, you have to open customization or add comparison, click add filter, select a dimension from a long dropdown, then select dimension value from another dropdown, then apply (and you can only select one). \u201cGranted it is only a few seconds difference, but when you look at many different patterns every day, it becomes frustrating to repeat those excess UI moves over and over when you used to do it faster.\u201d \u201cThat same dropdown structure is used in creating/editing GA4 reports. The dropdown lists are long and it is hard to find what you are looking for. You can type in partial names and more quickly find them once you know them, but initially it is very hard to scroll through them all and find what you want. \u201cAlso, you can only select one so it is hard to look at multiple dimensions/values. I don\u2019t know the answer to fixing this, but I do find it clumsy to use.\u201d\n\n2. Data lag\n\nAnother major concern for marketers has been the delay of same day data on GA4.\n\nAdvertisers have stressed that they need the ability to monitor performance constantly and are confused as to why the new analytics platform doesn\u2019t appear to have this function.\n\nRon Weber, Sr Director at Actian, explained:\n\n\u201cThe data latency is a joke, taking 12-24 hours to report on what is happening prevents this from being an actionable tool.\u201d \u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t backlogged for the past few years and thus could/would have realized this before.\u201d \u201cMaybe Google will just move the computing power from UA -> GA4 so that this will change? [praying]!\u201d\n\n3. Data discrepancies\n\nMarketers raised concerns about discrepancies on GA4 too. Differences in information had resulted in some worrying that the data being served therefore couldn\u2019t possibly be accurate, resulting in people questioning if they can trust GA4.\n\nOne marketer, who wished to remain anonymous, told us:\n\n\u201cWhat I find problematic is the discrepancy between GA4 API and the respective Looker Studio Connector. Dimensions that are present in the API and even per default in the GA4 reporting interface are apparently missing in the Looker Studio connector, e.g. Landing Page dimension.\u201d \u201cThe Google Team seems to work on that, because at least the landing page dimension is now present. But that also means that I have to minus two days before UA data collection comes to an end \u2013 then adjust and check my numerous reports again and again. \u201cI am as ready as the tool is, but I certainly do not look forward to working solely with GA4. I am also thinking about looking for alternative tools to GA4.\u201c\n\n4. Hard to use\n\nMarketers across the board have been reporting that GA4 is incredibly difficult to use. Even seasoned advertisers are finding it challenging trying to navigate their way around the new platform.\n\nSEO and marketing consultant Jason McDonald told us:\n\n\u201cGA4 is a disaster. It is so much harder to use than UA, and completely non-intuitive.\u201d \u201cIt is nearly impossible to drill down by clicking as was possible than UA. \u201cIt is the Windows Vista of Google Analytics, and all the cognoscenti are afraid to say publicly that it is garbage. But everyone knows it is garbage.\u201d\n\n5. Lack of resources\n\nWith so many marketers struggling as they try to figure out GA4, many are questioning why Google hasn\u2019t provided more educational resources explaining how the new tool works.\n\nThe marketing team at Storis told us:\n\n\u201cI found most of the answers that I was stuck on from taking private courses through SMX or finally getting to a knowledgeable Google team member. \u201cTheir documentation really lacked especially where there were major functional changes or gaps. I kept trying to figure out how to replicate things that weren\u2019t brought over. \u201cAlso, many of the people on Google\u2019s own team aren\u2019t up to speed making support calls confusing.\u201d\n\n6. No basic option\n\nSome advertisers explained that marketing doesn\u2019t wear a one size fits all hat. While some of the more complex settings may suit some, other professionals, such as bloggers, would just like access to basic tools on GA4 and are wasting time and money trying to understand features they don\u2019t need to use.\n\nEb Gargano from Productive Blogging told us:\n\n\u201cOne of the things I have observed is that many bloggers and online businesses have been totally losing their minds over GA4 \u2013 wasting days (and in some cases weeks) stressing over this, when their time could have been much better spent elsewhere.\u201d \u201cThe truth is most bloggers and online businesses need only a simple setup and an understanding of the basic reports. But no one is saying that, and online business owners are being scared into believing they need to spend lots of money on expensive courses and a lot of time creating multiple custom reports.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a real shame there isn\u2019t a \u2018GA4 Lite\u2019 for users who only need basic data.\u201d\n\n7. Lack of features\n\nAnother common complaint from marketers responding to our poll was the lack of features GA4 has to offer in comparison to Universal Analytics.\n\nMarketers seemed particularly bothered by the removal of attribution features.\n\nElizabeth Rule, account manager and local SEO analyst for Sterling Sky, told us:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been using GA4 as much as possible the past month to get used to it, but honestly it just feels like a clunkier version of GA3 with fewer features that I actually want to use. \u201cI find myself wanting to go back to GA3 every time I use GA4 \u2013 and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m just too used to it. Some of the features I use every day are missing or extremely complicated to find in GA4.\u201d\n\n8. Difficulty recreating reports\n\nClients and marketers alike have desperately been trying to recreate reports in GA4 that they previously relied upon when using Universal Analytics.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems for many that this task has proved far more difficult than it should have been.\n\nTom Demers, co-founder and managing partner of SEO and PPC agency Measured SEM, told us:\n\n\u201cClients are frustrated with recreating their existing reports in GA4, particularly for specific edge cases, recreating dashboards in third-party reporting tools \u2013 including Looker Studio.\u201d \u201cThere is also a lot of work around recreating events / goals within GA4 (and confusion around not seeing those events in certain reports).\u201d\n\n9. Reports\n\nMarketers also complained that they were struggling to simply create reports in GA4 \u2014 an issue that didn\u2019t impact them when they were working with UA.\n\nAccording to many marketers who took part in our poll, Google has made many unnecessary changes when it comes to building reports, making their workload more difficult.\n\nEric Bushaw, search engine optimization manager at G5, told us:\n\n\u201cIn time, I think GA4 will enable greater insights than UA did.\u201d \u201cWith that said, some of the seemingly arbitrary changes to how reporting can be done are frustrating. \u201cEliminating views, restrictions around how custom segments can be used, and other seemingly unnecessary changes are going to make life difficult for us once UA is really gone.\u201d\n\n10. Bugs\n\nSeveral marketers contacted Search Engine Land to report bugs within GA4, claiming many features weren\u2019t working as intended. Issues being flagged included syncing issues with Looker Studio Dashboard and AMP new script not working.\n\nSEO consultant John McAlpin told us:\n\n\u201cThe platform still has a lot of bugs, and we find ourselves spending more time figuring out why attribution is not properly labeled and why the data is inconsistent.\u201d Dig deeper: Find our GA4 coverage here\n\nDon\u2019t panic\n\nMarketers have found the enforced migration from Universal Analytics to GA4 tough, so it can be reassuring to know this challenge is being felt across the industry.\n\nBut regardless of how difficult the adjustment has been, search marketing expert Kayle Larkin told us it\u2019s important that marketers get on board with Google\u2019s latest analytics program as it will likely be around for a long time. She said:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an age-old saying that the grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side.\u201d \u201cPeople use the internet in completely different ways than in 2012, and I see GA4 as Google\u2019s answer for future-proofing website analytics. The industry needs a free option.\u201d \u201cMarketers need to pause for a moment and think about what information is really useful and helpful \u2013 what they need to know.\u201d \u201cHimanshu Sharma said it well on LinkedIn: \u2018It is important to remember that we are not in the business of data retrieval. We are in the business of data analysis to improve ROI.'\u201d \u201cEither way, you need to understand your data and how that supports your marketing initiatives.\u201d\n\nLarkin went on to explain that change within any platform and any industry can cause people to panic. But as time passes, confidence and familiarity increases, causing attitudes to change. She concluded:\n\n\u201cEveryone was mad when Facebook updated their interface and \u2018couldn\u2019t find anything\u2019. It was \u2018horrible\u2019 and \u2018the end of Facebook.'\u201d \u201cBecause we use Facebook daily, that was quickly forgotten, and no one even remembers what the old interface looked like.\u201d \u201cThe response to the GA4\u2019s interface \u2013 you see the same reaction when any platform changes its interface. People do not like change.\u201d \u201cBut GA4 is so customizable, and with LookerStudio \u2014 there are a lot of options for getting the reports to visualize information and insights in a meaningful way.\u201d", "date": "2023-07-07"}, {"link": "https://martech.org/the-latest-jobs-in-martech/", "title": "The latest jobs in martech", "content": "Constantine von Hoffman is managing editor of MarTech.

Amazon Prime members will have access to deals, while Amazon\u2019s competitors will court bargain-hunters online and in-store. As a result, it\u2019s a great snapshot of ecommerce trends.\n\nWhy we care. As this year\u2019s Prime Day proves, digital retail is never exclusively online. Top retailers are using a combination of digital and in-store deals to cover the multichannel ways shoppers look for deals.\n\nThis time last year, there were questions about how inflation and lingering supply chain issues might hinder sales. The 2022 event indicated that consumers were ready to buy online if the price was right \u2014 U.S. online sales approached $12 billion over those two days, up 8.5% from 2021.\n\nPrime Day competition. While Amazon is expected to offer discounted prices on top categories like electronics, toys and home goods, other top retailers will look to poach shoppers next week as well.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of top Prime Day promotions compiled by mobile and consumer data platform data.ai.\n\nMany of the promotions are tied to loyalty programs. Target\u2019s weeklong deals are exclusive to Target Circle members, while Walmart will provide early access to Walmart+ members before opening up deals to the public.\n\n\u201cTarget, Walmart, Nordstrom and Best Buy have joined Amazon with key summer sales the past few years outside of the traditional 4th of July weekend,\u201d said Kassi Socha, director analyst in the Gartner Marketing Practice. \u201cOur year-over-year consumer research has observed growth in consumers shopping both sooner and in some cases, year-round for winter holidays. The more retailers bolster their promotional marketing during this timeframe, the more the consumer will be trained to pull forward their winter holiday shopping.\u201d\n\nDig deeper: Why we care about loyalty marketing\n\nHybrid shopping. \u201cConsumer adoption of hybrid shopping services is increasing,\u201d Socha said. \u201cCompetitors to Amazon have strengthened their omnichannel offerings and may boost their summer sales results this year because they can get purchases to the consumer faster through buy-online-pickup-in-store, curbside pickup, or same day delivery.\u201d\n\nGroceries. The wider adoption of hybrid shopping means this year\u2019s Prime Day promotions could open up non-traditional ecommerce categories, like groceries.\n\nAmerican consumers report high intent to splurge on restaurants and groceries, according to data.ai. Walmart and Target are well-positioned to capitalize on this with their ecommerce promotions, and by attracting foot traffic from habitual grocery shoppers.\n\nTop categories. Omnichannel marketing platform Skai surveyed 1,000 consumers ahead of Prime Day to find out the top product categories shoppers were considering.\n\nHere\u2019s how the top categories ranked:\n\nConsumer electronics Household products Fashion and apparel Beauty and personal care Pets Toys and games.\n\nLong and short game. Consumers are also willing to spend the time to hunt the best online deals, and they are ready to pounce on Prime Day if the price is right, Skai found.\n\nSixty-one percent of respondents said they started researching products over a month in advance of Prime Day. And 63% said they are happy to wait until Prime Day to find a better deal, even if the product they were eyeing was already on sale prior to the promotion.\n\nPrivate labels. The demand for lower prices could find retailers promoting discounted store brands this Prime Day.\n\n\u201cA number of multibrand retailers have expanded their private label store brand assortment to appeal to price-conscious consumers impacted by inflation and improve their margins,\u201d said Brad Jashinsky, director analyst in the Gartner Marketing Practice.\n\n\u201cThe private label unit sales growth we see from Target, Walmart, and other multi-brand retailers is an indicator that pricing and macroeconomic conditions may be pushing consumers to trade down. We anticipate the trend will continue and impact summer sale results, making the need for brands to differentiate on quality and value important as consumers face difficult economic conditions.\u201d\n\nHybrid shoppers who research online and are flexible about shopping online or in-store will have a wide variety of deals to choose from during Prime Day.", "date": "2023-07-06"}, {"link": "https://martech.org/the-latest-ai-powered-martech-tools/", "title": "The latest AI-powered martech tools", "content": "Before we get to this week\u2019s round-up of AI-powered martech, I thought I\u2019d share the results of a consumer survey by infosec company Malwarebytes.\n\nWhile you and I and everyone I know professionally are all about AI only 35% of those surveyed respondents agreed with the statement \u201cI am familiar with ChatGPT,\u201d and 50% disagreed.\n\nOf those who said they were familiar with ChatGPT:\n\n12% agree the information produced by ChatGPT is accurate\n\n81% are concerned about possible security and safety risks\n\n63% distrust ChatGPT information\n\n51% question whether AI tools can improve internet safety\n\n52% want ChatGPT developments paused in order for regulations to catch up\n\nAn interesting snapshot of where public opinion stands right now.\n\nDig deeper: AI and marketing: What the stats show\n\nNow, on to the new products, features, integrations and enhancements.\n\nMixpanel added OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 Turbo to its event analytics platform.

You\u2019re doing great work but not seeing the results you expected? It\u2019s almost always the result of one fundamental piece that\u2019s missing.\n\nLast year, I found myself stuck in the middle of a corn maze. I was lost, confused and disoriented. It was nearly impossible to find my way out and it took countless wrong turns and endless frustration.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I didn\u2019t have a map, I couldn\u2019t see which turns were getting me closer to the exit and which were leading me astray. I lacked perspective, and I had no insights about the moves I was making.\n\nIf I had a map of the maze or an aerial picture of it, navigating it would be exponentially easier. If I knew what steps would get me where I wanted to go, navigating the maze be simpler and faster. And it would be less stressful and a lot less exhausting.\n\nMarketing is a maze and you need a map. That map is insights.\n\nInsights give you perspective. They show you what works and what doesn\u2019t. They map out the steps you need to take to get to where you want to go.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling lost or confused and if your marketing doesn\u2019t seem to be getting you to your destination \u2014 you just need the right insights.\n\nWhat are insights, anyway?\n\n\u201cInsights\u201d is one of those funny marketing buzzwords that gets tossed around, yet no one really knows what it actually means.\n\nLet\u2019s fix that. Here\u2019s my definition:\n\nInsights are the patterns you\u2019ve observed, unique to your business and customers, which have been validated by reliable evidence and data and provide confidence and direction about what works and what doesn\u2019t in achieving the desired result.\n\nThey\u2019re the bumpers on the bowling alley that keep you moving forward and prevent you from falling into the gutter.\n\nAn industry benchmark, anecdotal evidence or industry expertise are not insights. Insights come from:\n\nThe preferences and behaviors of your best customers.\n\nThe conversations your support staff has daily.\n\nThe meetings your sales team has with prospects.\n\nThe experiments that your team runs every month.\n\nWhen you see and hear what works and have evidence to support it, you can form a perspective, a pattern or a process. Doing X leads to Y. That\u2019s an insight.\n\nInsights could be as simple as a specific format of image that leads to higher conversion rates. Or a journey that captures more high-quality leads than normal. And in many cases, insights are about the emotional aspects that drive customer behavior, including the \u201cmagic words\u201d that make customers\u2019 eyes light up.\n\nThey\u2019re unique to your business and your customers. You can\u2019t borrow them or steal them from your competition. (So stop trying.) You also can\u2019t sit around and think them up from thin air. You need to take action, engage with your customers, listen and pay attention to create insights.\n\nThe power of insights\n\nExecuting without the right insights is like running around a maze without tracking where you\u2019ve been. You\u2019ll waste time and energy and repeat your mistakes ad nauseam. Most companies waste their time, effort and budget because they aren\u2019t operating with enough \u2014 or the right \u2014 insights.\n\nWith the right insights, you can effortlessly outperform your competition, even if they\u2019re bigger than you and have more money to spend.\n\nLet that sink in for a moment. If you have a small team or a tight budget, insights are even more important to the success of your marketing.\n\nSimply put, insights are the main competitive advantage any marketing organization can have.\n\nWhy are insights so important? Because insights = outcomes. The more insights you have, the better your outcomes will be. No insights = no outcomes. Big insights = big outcomes.\n\nImagine playing poker where everyone else\u2019s cards were face up. It would be pretty easy to know how to maximize your chances of winning, right?\n\nThat\u2019s what having powerful insights is all about. The more you know and understand, the better decisions you can make and the better outcomes you can create. But it\u2019s not easy to find and capture insights. It takes effort and intentionality.\n\nYou need to approach your marketing to figure out what works and looking for the patterns you can extract and translate into actionable insights.\n\nThe more time and effort you invest in gaining insights, the less time and effort you need to invest in brute forcing your marketing to deliver.\n\nAnd time is a big factor because insights decay over time. What worked last year doesn\u2019t work this year. What works today won\u2019t work forever.\n\nGaining insights and applying them is an ongoing need that every marketer must be focused on.\n\nWhat insights do you need?\n\nHere\u2019s what every marketing team should be asking themselves:\n\nWhat insights do we need? And how will we get them?\n\nIf you make that your quest, you\u2019ll find that exceeding your goals and obliterating your targets becomes simple.\n\nMarketers face an onslaught of distractions and demands, but we must remain focused on gaining the leverage to drive transformational results. And once you start getting valuable insights, decide how, where and when you will apply them.\n\nEvery campaign, creative asset and piece of copy should be informed by the collection of insights you\u2019ve acquired. And each of these should, in turn, lead to more insights.\n\nCollect, compile and collate your insights into an \u201cinsights library\u201d \u2014 a shared place that everyone internally can consume, comment on and contribute to.\n\nWhen your marketing team and your organization are focused on insights, you can guarantee the success of your marketing.", "date": "2023-07-06"}, {"link": "https://martech.org/eus-ruling-against-facebook-a-big-blow-to-first-party-data-usage/", "title": "EU\u2019s ruling against Facebook a big blow to first-party data usage", "content": "Facebook and other tech giants will be hard-pressed to monetize their first-party data in the European Union, following a ruling yesterday by the EU\u2019s top court that shot down Facebook\u2019s \u201clegitimate interest\u201d argument for personalized ads.\n\nWhat it means. The ruling is a shot across the bow for many big tech businesses, says Tim Parkin, president of Parkin Consulting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to hit a bigger target and that\u2019s exactly what the regulators are trying to do,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they can stop (or slow down) Meta, they can prevent the rest of big tech from causing the same issues.\u201d\n\nParkin believes this and other EU actions will put an end to the current digital marketing paradigm.\n\n\u201cThe bigger concern for all of big tech is that the data privacy and protection war is heating up,\u201d he says. \u201cThe business model of making the customer the product was once viable and is now threatened. We\u2019ll continue to see big tech take a step towards paid subscriptions and away from ad-supported platforms.\u201d\n\nWhat happened. In 2019, Facebook parent Meta sued German regulators who ordered the social media giant to stop collecting users\u2019 data without their consent. They said that not only was Facebook violating the EU\u2019s GDPR, but that its dominance in social media made this an antitrust issue as well.\n\nDig deeper: EU fines Facebook $1.3 billion for privacy violations\n\nThe decision. The ruling says users\u2019 privacy interest overrides the \u201clegitimate interest\u201d argument of Facebook to personalize ads. It said that even though Facebook is free to users, \u201cthe user of that network cannot reasonably expect\u201d that it will use large volumes of data to personalize ads \u201cwithout his or her consent.\u201d\n\nThe decision shouldn\u2019t have surprised anyone, says Gartner\u2019s Matt Moorut.\n\n\u201cThe European Union has been fighting for greater protection of consumers\u2019 data for years, so the ruling, while a surprise in the timing, isn\u2019t a massive surprise in terms of its existence,\u201d says Moorut, director analyst in the Gartner Marketing Practice. \u201cGDPR established opt-ins for use of data for email by default years ago, so this is simply a continuation of the principles already codified in law.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next. While the ruling only applies to Germany, a new digital competition law will soon impose similar rules across the EU. Starting in March of next year, the Digital Markets Act requires services with at least 45 million monthly active EU users to get user consent to\n\nProcess personal user data,\n\nCombine it with data from other platforms\n\nCross-use data from one service to another.\n\nUsers who don\u2019t consent must still be able to use the service.\n\nWhy we care. With the end of third-party cookies drawing nigh, first-party data has been touted as the best, most reliable source of consumer information. Now, in the EU at least, there\u2019s good reason to doubt that.\n\nMarketers don\u2019t have to worry about this happening in the U.S., which has yet to enact even more basic national privacy protections. Even so, it will further complicate data collection and use here for companies doing business in the EU.", "date": "2023-07-05"}, {"link": "https://martech.org/how-to-handle-changes-in-agile-marketing/", "title": "How to handle changes in agile marketing", "content": "Agile marketing is all about change, but how do we balance agility and chaos? Let\u2019s explore three components of the Agile Marketing Navigator framework the Guidepoint, Blueprint and Marketing Backlog \u2014 and where frequent change is acceptable and what areas to keep change to a minimum.\n\nChanging the Guidepoint\n\nThe Guidepoint is the \u201cbig win\u201d for an agile team that\u2019s decided either quarterly or based on a major project or campaign. It\u2019s what guides the team toward success and narrows their focus.\n\nThe Guidepoint should remain pretty constant once agreed upon by the team and stakeholders. Since it\u2019s done fairly frequently (at least once a quarter) and is so high-level, it shouldn\u2019t have to change. The only reason that a Guidepoint would change is if there was a major shift in business priorities at a higher level than the team.\n\nDig deeper: MetLife uses agile marketing to unleash pet insurance sales\n\nFor example, your team\u2019s quarterly Guidepoint is:\n\nCreate an omni-channel marketing campaign to improve our organic beauty sales by 20% this quarter.\n\nYou just learned that the organic beauty line is being acquired by another company and it\u2019s no longer a priority for your business stakeholders. This type of business change would require a pivot.\n\nHowever, if it was simply because a stakeholder wants to do something else now, that would require a conversation because interrupting a team\u2019s mojo will seriously impact productivity.\n\nGeneral rule: The Guidepoint shouldn\u2019t change.\n\nChanging the Blueprint\n\nThe Blueprint is the quarterly roadmap of work the team uses to meet its Guidepoint. This is meant to be flexible rather than set in stone, and shifts and changes to the Blueprint during its shelf life (typically three months) are perfectly acceptable.\n\nThe team and its business stakeholders should review it together regularly (every week or two) to see if the work listed is still the highest priority. Because agile marketing is all about testing and learning, the team may have discovered what they thought was a brilliant idea isn\u2019t panning out and they need to pivot \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s encouraged to pivot away from work that isn\u2019t performing as expected and to try something new.\n\nGeneral rule: The Blueprint can change.\n\nChanging the Marketing Backlog\n\nThe Marketing Backlog is the prioritized ordered list of work that the team plans to do in the future. This artifact is meant to be flexible and changing, so re-ordering the backlog, changing work, adding work and deleting work are encouraged. This is easy because the team hasn\u2019t invested any time in doing this work yet.\n\nHowever, where to proceed with caution is when work moves from the Marketing Backlog and into the five- or 10-day cycle. This is when the team is actively working on executing tactics and switching priorities at this point is discouraged.\n\nWhile everything in agile marketing should be looked at pragmatically and not rigidly, changing work midstream can cause frustration from team members and the lack of ability to accomplish anything. So, proceed with caution on any changes during this time.\n\nGeneral rule: Changes are encouraged at any time in the Marketing Backlog. However, once work moves from the backlog into the cycle, changes have a big impact on productivity, so proceed with caution.", "date": "2023-07-05"}, {"link": "https://martech.org/marketers-roast-google-analytics-4/", "title": "Marketers roast Google Analytics 4", "content": "Marketers aren\u2019t having the easiest time migrating from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4. Some are so frustrated with the new tool, that they\u2019ve even been holding funerals for UA in the hope that Google might get the message and make a sudden U-turn.\n\nIn conjunction with Search Engine Land, we recently ran a poll to find out how the industry is coping and to give marketers an opportunity to get their voices heard \u2014 and the feedback was interesting to say the least.\n\nThe enforced switchover is a historic transitional moment in digital marketing history, and we know it\u2019s a big adjustment. But if you don\u2019t laugh, you\u2019ll cry. So with that in mind, we\u2019ve put together a list of the funniest reactions we received to Google\u2019s enforced GA4 switchover. Enjoy!\n\nShort and sweet. Some marketers were able to summarise their experiences with GA4 in just a few words.\n\n\u201cMad! Mad! Mad!\n\n\u201cTotal cr*p!\u201d\n\n\u201cGA4 = LAME!\u201d\n\n\u201cOne word (in fact two words): BS!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a waste of our time.\u201d\n\nGA4 UI team should be fired.\n\n\u201cGoogle should be ashamed!\u201d Marketers certainly know how to articulate their frustrations. They also know how to dish out some pretty epic one liners. We\u2019re so glad we won\u2019t be answering calls on the GA4 customer service desk this week.\n\n\u201cDid they find the software in a Christmas cracker? The biggest pile of sh*t I have ever seen. Unusable for scenario of casual small business owner with a simple question about their stats. I can only conclude that Google deliberately wanted to obfuscate people\u2019s access to their own website data. If it doesn\u2019t get better, considering removing from many customers\u2019 sites because it is just pointless drag on speed stats.\u201d\n\n\u201cGA4 is potentially the worst product update ever from a pure usability perspective, and Google should be ashamed of its current state.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle trying to do tableau for dummies is not working on either level.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply put, GA4 Sucks. It is a pain in the a*s to use (NOT USABLE) requires much more time than previous version lacks the same visual impact as GA3 it is junk.\u201d\n\nMind games. What if Google secretly designed GA4 with a hidden agenda; to get marketers to stop using its own tools and turn to its competition instead? Makes sense. Kinda. Well, not really.\n\n\u201cThis might be the least user-friendly product Google has ever produced. Almost like they don\u2019t want people to use it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m outta here. A fantastic solution if you\u2019re not a fan of GA4; turn on your Out Of Office, go on vacation and wait for all of this to blow over. Of course, it probably won\u2019t. But definitely a great short-term option.\n\n\u201cI have been dreading the arrival of this date so much that I booked a trip out of town. LOL. My hope is that by the time I return from vacation, Google will have changed their mind, and Universal Analytics will continue to exist.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t make me. Alternatively, if you\u2019re not in a position to take a vacation right now, just close your eyes, pretend GA4 isn\u2019t happening and do nothing. What could possibly go wrong?\n\n\u201cOur marketing department doesn\u2019t have the faintest idea how to follow complex directions. And most of them are out of the office for the next two weeks. So IT kicked the project over to our business insights department, who swiftly said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to do with Google Analytics anymore. Talk to Marketing. Now it looks like the project is mine. I\u2019m a one-person department. I\u2019m not gonna do sh*t. That\u2019s my GA4-adjacent sob story.\u201d\n\nWhy we care: We\u2019re all in the same boat right now \u2014 publishers as well as marketers. After 11 years of relying so heavily on Universal Analytics, migrating over to GA4 is a daunting task. But unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a choice (unless you want to consider a GA4 alternative). So we might as well get our heads down and try to figure it all out. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have a laugh along the way.", "date": "2023-07-05"}, {"link": "https://martech.org/go-to-market-tactics-that-wont-work-in-a-post-pandemic-world/", "title": "Go-to-market tactics that won\u2019t work in a post-pandemic world", "content": "Looking forward to the second half of 2023, we are recalibrating go-to-market plans for what I call the \u201cnext normal.\u201d\n\nBrands were working on transformative GTM efforts pre-pandemic. But then many of them, including startups, simply redlined through the crisis at maximum speed. From my analysis, the significant new GTM investments we saw led to severely diminishing returns. And all this at record high costs.\n\nBut then we saw savvy enterprises and startups begin to switch gear. They shared our long-term GTM mindset and that helped to make them resilient through the pandemic. Well-strategized, thoroughly researched and carefully tailored GTM efforts provided greater operational advantages.\n\nBut it\u2019s of primary importance to avoid mistakes. Below, I share some of the strategies and tactics that were once popular in a well-funded environment, but which are no longer sustainable or deliver reduced returns.\n\nThe category creation aspiration failure\n\nPopularized by evangelists from high-growth point solutions, this advice to create a new category was both the least achievable and most costly. In researching ~15k companies for the martech landscape with Scott Brinker, I saw perhaps one in a thousand successfully creating a new category.\n\nMost startups, for example in the ABM space, were really doing no more than magnifying or repackaging existing categories. Tens of millions of dollars in venture investments and enterprise budgets were wasted on failed category creation.\n\nWhat to do instead\u2026\n\nTry \u201cproblem identification.\u201d Focusing on your serviceable addressable market (SAM) will provide guidance for the best use of your resources. Your SAM is the segment of your total addressable market achievable with your current business model.\n\nInstead of creating clever combinations of terms or names for your offerings, develop narratives that resonate with stakeholders\u2019 identities. If there is a category to be created, let it grow organically rather than try to force it.\n\nMaking marketing an afterthought\n\nWhen marketing is done incorrectly, you can severely injure your brand. When a brand is complacent about marketing, the energy needed to engage customers diminishes. As experiential muscles atrophy, you can see a loss of market share.\n\nMarketing operations has become increasingly critical to a business\u2019s capabilities. It\u2019s not uncommon, however, to target marketing or marketing ops when budget cutbacks are necessary. There\u2019s even an assumption that sales owns enough relationships to sustain a company through hard times.\n\nThat\u2019s a very high risk strategy.\n\nWhat to do instead\u2026\n\nA company\u2019s growth and resilience depend on engagement with the customer. Even if you can\u2019t build extra marketing muscle, you still need to remain toned.\n\nOf course marketing budgets will fluctuate. Establish essential core services and operational teams and set expectations of what can be achieved during cutbacks. Also, consider hiring a sales-aligned marketing leader and establish higher-than-average comp for the long term.\n\nGoing all-in on growth hacking\n\nIn the service of \u201cgrowth hacking,\u201d companies with an influx of funds rushed to hire fast and recklessly. They applied agile practices without thoughtful direction. Unfortunately, this wasted development cycles, investment, and, most importantly, time.\n\nAn early startup I once worked with thought they had found lightning in a bottle. Thrilled with the flurry of growth, they stayed comfortably in their lane. Unfortunately, they never took our longer-term strategic advice to expand their point solution into a platform. By the time they did, it was too late. While still operating, they never really recovered \u2014 even after over $100M in more funding.\n\nWhat to do instead\u2026\n\nStrategic planning and planning for contingencies are back in fashion. We saw companies recalibrate their strategies post-pandemic. Seasoned peers or cross-industry advisors provided the best guidance to recapture market share. We encouraged investment into reviewing their decision-making through Decision Intelligence practices.\n\nOver-engineering the customer experience\n\nCX is one of the most valued company assets in gaining market share and growing margins. But as brands sped up digital transformation, many advisors and evangelists suggested boiling the ocean on customer engagement. This led to over-engineered journey orchestrations and automation that left customers frustrated.\n\nA recently IPOed company brought me and a few other consultants in to help solve a loss in market share. It turned out that massive endeavors in the field of digital transformation and CX were largely undefined and disconnected from specific business goals.\n\nWhat to do instead\u2026\n\nIt was a good attempt. But the new approaches needed more time to marinate with customers, especially for the brand to be able to understand their responses. The accelerated framework didn\u2019t allow this.\n\nTogether with the CRO and COO, we identified over-engineered experiences. We monitored priority use cases and reactivated customer advisory boards. Many loyal customers attempted to navigate these \u201cinnovative\u201d experiences, but due to the implementation speed, the duct-taped, ad hoc solutions created experience doldrums.\n\nWhile customers remained loyal, LTV:CAC ratio plunged. There was also a drop in average contract value and referrals. It was necessary to rethink rushed experiences.\n\nThird-party Data\n\nOnce inexpensive as a build-awareness resource, third-party data has lost its allure especially as it is likely soon to be deprecated from the last major browser that tracks it (Chrome). We have discovered, however, that some brands are paralyzed in transition away from it. They lacked the capabilities, insights, leadership, or talent to adapt. Many of these brands are in wait-and-see mode.\n\nWhat to do instead\u2026\n\nOn the flip side, losing third-party data can be a ripe opportunity to capture market share from the competition. Brands that built genuine customer relationships \u2014 including through first-party data \u2014 and gain market trust will see minimal impact. Increase the use of and investment in your customer database; and take a fresh look at contextual advertising.\n\nMore GTM tactics to shift away from\n\nSidelined partnerships. Partners are more than window dressing for your brand. In a post-pandemic era, the return of brand building includes enhancing your ecosystem. Advocates and partners help customers connect with your shared purpose.\n\nIgnoring utilization. Tech stacks matter, but more is not always better. Budget cutbacks are forcing organizations to streamline operations. No more pointless data hoarding or prolific, random acquisitions of technology point solutions.\n\nThe single North Star metric. One key GTM metric may have seemed justified when navigating growth at all costs. But the pandemic revealed that dozens of underlying factors could provide good indicators of progress. These also should be closely monitored and managed for sustained growth. Owning these key operational metrics can help avoid being blindsided and support new opportunities.\n\nRandom acts of sales. Even before the pandemic, sales could act as an independent fiefdom. Reps used whatever tactics they could to close deals. Of course, sales reps are going to optimize the route to conversion. But teams still need consistent guidance on pricing, tools, narratives, and general intel about products and services. Inconsistent and disconnected sales engagements created enormous gaps in opportunity and growth. Sales is a team sport both within the sales organization and in alignment with other teams.\n\nWinning by checking boxes. Feature lists, in competitive situations, now pale in comparison with value creation. Understanding the customer\u2019s capabilities and use cases across different teams is often necessary.\n\nCustomers have the power\n\nWhen funding was abundant, leaders sacrificed long-term GTM success for short-term gains. Repeating these playbooks was easy as customers had less power. The tables have turned.\n\nEven in the post-pandemic period, marketplace dynamics continue to require investments into ecosystem strategies, right-sized customer engagements, and strong partner relationships. Technology, operational effectiveness, and value creation narratives serve as growth engines as we navigate the global \u201cnext normal.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve only listed a handful of the GTM concepts that are fast becoming less effective in the post-pandemic era.

AI wasn\u2019t even on the radar, while these skills were:\n\nSEO (53%)\n\nData analytics (48%)\n\nIntegration of new technologies (46%)\n\nWriting and editing (40%)\n\nAudio/video creation (34%).\n\nWe asked this year\u2019s Content Marketing World presenters which skills will help content marketers meet the challenges we all face today \u2013 and the unexpected developments of the next several years.\n\nAI takes center stage in the advice from the experts who offered their advice. But the full range of answers includes unique takes, unexpected advice, and helpful reminders about content marketing skills to carry you today and through 2028.\n\nData privacy, strategy, and innovation\n\nWe all need to continue to focus on data privacy compliance to ensure that we\u2019re not collecting, storing, or using data in a way that creates risk for the customer or our business. Understanding the potential to leverage blockchain and Web3 solutions to manage data collection and storage will be key to creating hyper-personalized content over the next five years.\n\nMarketers must develop the ability to look at the big picture and identify opportunities. Strategy, creativity, and innovation will be essential skills as more routine work gets turned over to AI. \u2013 Brian Piper, director of content strategy and assessment, University of Rochester\n\nIt\u2019s critical to have a basic knowledge of what artificial intelligence is, what it means for marketing and business, and how to identify and pilot programs based on existing business problems or use cases. Marketers need to overcome the fear of AI to understand how it can help us do our jobs and love our work even more. \u2013 Cathy McPhillips, chief growth officer, Marketing Artificial Intelligence Institute\n\nYou don\u2019t need to become a systems engineer or obtain a Ph.D. in linear algebra. However, having a solid grasp of the fundamental architectures at play and understanding how they relate to various aspects of marketing \u2013 such as content creation, distribution, and audience consumption \u2013 is highly beneficial.\n\nCompanies are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to streamline operations, save time and money, and boost marketing productivity. Here\u2019s the bottom line: AI won\u2019t take your job. A marketer skilled at AI will take the job of a marketer who is not. Therefore, acquiring a working knowledge of AI principles is key to staying ahead in marketing. \u2013 Christopher Penn, chief data scientist, TrustInsights.ai\n\nTwo words: Prompt engineering (i.e., how to do it effectively). \u2013 Dennis Shiao, founder, Attention Retention\n\nCustomer-centricity, resilience, and adaptability\n\nAs marketing landscapes become more competitive and marketing activities become more complex, marketers must think outside the box and develop innovative solutions to their challenges. This includes fostering a creative mindset with your team, embracing experimentation and testing, and being open to new ideas and approaches by continuously learning, especially about new technologies and trends.\n\nWe can hone these skills by embracing diverse perspectives, brainstorming, and maintaining a customer-centric approach that can spark innovation. Cultivating resilience, adaptability, and a \u201ctest, learn, and adapt\u201d mindset is also key, and it can be done while integrating AI into our work. \u2013 Andi Robinson, content consultant, Hijinx Marketing\n\nA test-learn-adapt mindset\n\nVersatility, adaptability, and transparency will become critical to delivering high-quality work reliably. Efficiencies due to technology will help marketers expand the ways they work, from channel delivery and outputs to targeted outcomes based on niche audiences and data analysis. It may also mean a shift from external content creation to new ways of working within and across internal teams.\n\nKey skills to boost results include communication and engagement around change, user research about customers and team members, and ways to unblock problems based on collaboration and experimentation. \u2013 Melissa Breker, change facilitation and support, Breker Group\n\nBravery and risk tolerance\n\nMarketers are deeply impacted by an organization\u2019s inability to tolerate risk. Because customers and clients are humans first (and buyers second), connecting with them as such will help differentiate one company from another. Milquetoast content will get milquetoast results. We, as marketers, need to fight for innovation and connection in our content to ensure we can rise to the growing revenue expectations. \u2013 Maureen Jann, chief marketing strategist and CEO, NeoLuxe Marketing\n\nIndividuals and companies that will have staying power are compelling storytellers and not afraid to address the serious issues faced by their audience. That will make their content remarkable, memorable, and able to achieve long-lasting impact.\n\nTV shows like Mister Roger\u2019s Neighborhood and Star Trek told entertaining stories, and they weren\u2019t afraid to talk about topics that made others uncomfortable. Decades later, people still go back and view them for the lessons they provide, in addition to being enjoyable to watch. That\u2019s what gives them lasting value. \u2013 Ruth Carter, evil genius, Geek Law Firm\n\nKeeping calm and carrying content on\n\nWhether it is geopolitical issues, technological advancements, or economic turbulence, the world is much harder to predict today than pre-2020. This doesn\u2019t mean chasing after every fad. Figure out which trends matter and which are just noise. Learn to tweak your tactics to respond to a changing environment without panicking. \u2013 Jesse Harris, digital marketing coordinator, ACD/Labs\n\nRegister to attend Content Marketing World in Washington, D.C. Use the code BLOG100 to save $100.\n\nDifferentiated writing\n\nShore up your writing skills. Regardless of those who say generative AI will replace writers, I say that having strong writers who can create original content will be more important than ever. Unique content will stand out in the sea of sameness that we\u2019ll increasingly see as more companies rely on robots to do their writing. \u2013 Michelle Garrett, consultant and writer, Garrett Public Relations\n\nTagging for audience segments\n\nA well-defined tagging structure or framework for categorizing content will be pivotal to how we label our assets. We can no longer rely solely on labeling content by format, such as \u201cblog post\u201d or \u201cwebinar.\u201d Instead, we must consider factors like buyer personas, industry verticals, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the buyer journey stages. \u2013 Randy Frisch, co-founder and chief brand officer, Uberflip\n\nStrategy, planning, and orchestration\n\nStrategic thinkers and planners will come out on top in the next five years as we see more automation of low-level marketing tasks. As AI tools create efficiencies and provide more information about prospect behaviors, interests, and preferences, marketers who can effectively analyze, customize, and apply AI-generated content and data to specific markets will benefit the most.\n\nSuccessful marketers will understand the business, study their target personas, care deeply about messaging, and have the skills to plan and orchestrate integrated marketing campaigns that span the entire customer journey. They will accomplish all of this in lockstep with sales and executive leadership. \u2013 Wendy Covey, co-founder and CEO, TREW Marketing\n\nStrategy, planning, and orchestration\n\nTalk to each other. Communicate. Share. Marketing has been incredibly splintered. Silos have always been a challenge, but COVID + remote work + channel-specific trends + social media fickleness = a greater divide and communication void across teams. (Don\u2019t get me wrong: I am 110% in favor of remote work \u2013 as long as there\u2019s strong communication.)\n\nTo succeed, marketers need to facilitate \u2013 and yes, even force \u2013 the collaboration, conversation, and connection points between different tactics, executions, and departments. The more your organization works together \u2013 talking, connecting, atomizing, and supporting each other\u2019s efforts \u2013 the more effective you\u2019ll be in using your resources, time, and budgets and reaching your various segments and audiences across multiple channels. \u2013 Jennifer Harmon, content strategist and creator, Convince & Convert\n\nStrategic prioritization\n\nMarketers need to develop the skill of discernment and the ability to say no, or they\u2019ll end up burned out from continually chasing the next shiny object. In researching our book, Change Fatigue: Flip Teams From Burnout to Buy-In, we talked to leaders and teams unable to accomplish much of anything because of so many competing initiatives.\n\nIf you slow down, plan strategically, and gather the team for a concerted effort instead of scattershot priorities, you\u2019ll have a significantly better chance of being ready for the next big thing. \u2013 Jenny Magic, founder, Better Way to Say It\n\nWorkload management and burnout avoidance\n\nMarketers need to stop thinking outside the box all the time. Sometimes thinking inside the box \u2013 and within your available resources \u2013 then maximizing what you\u2019re currently capable of will help reduce the possibility of campaigns or strategies that are too much to handle. \u2013 Leanna Pham, head of creative and social, Convince & Convert\n\nAudience research\n\nToo many marketers are reluctant to get in the head of their customers, opting to make assumptions instead. To get this critical information, you need to talk to customers. If you can\u2019t speak to them directly, work closely with customer-facing roles such as sales, customer success, or community to discover their pain points. Sit in on calls and demos to learn. If that\u2019s not an option, do social listening and scan review sites.\n\nWords from the customer make some of the most compelling marketing copy. With the rise of AI, there will be an explosion of content, but most of it won\u2019t be great. Marketers who can speak to their customers will win. \u2013 Adrienne Sheares, owner, ViviMae Labs\n\nBehavioral-science-backed messaging\n\nMarketers need to be better at creating messages that account for the ways people really make decisions. Very often, our customers don\u2019t even know the real reasons they buy things. They think they do, but science has shown that there are usually other factors at play that prompt the decision \u2013 factors people are often unaware of. These factors include hardwired psychological needs, such as feeling autonomy or minimizing loss.\n\nOver the next five years, the ability to understand how people make decisions and the skill to craft marketing messages that include relevant prompts will become increasingly important. Marketers will need a solid understanding of behavioral science to succeed. It will be the key to getting people to pay attention to a message, understand it, respond to it, and remember it, especially as AI-generated content continues to grow. \u2013 Nancy Harhut, chief creative officer, HBT Marketing\n\nDeep organization knowledge\n\nI\u2019d like to see more organizational longevity. There is a trend toward job-hopping. I get it \u2013 job-hopping has its benefits. But the depth of learning you get from company longevity can\u2019t be replaced. Moving up within an organization, learning more about how things work outside of your role, and gaining a deep understanding of systems and processes (and working to change them when needed) all come from time spent in one organization. I\u2019d love to see more resumes with three to five years at one company instead of nine to 12 months. \u2013 Ahava Leibtag, president, Aha Media Group\n\nConstant exploration and upskilling\n\nThe most essential marketing skill in the next five years will be the ability to learn on the job. This could mean embracing new tools, trying new processes, and acquiring new skills. Marketing changes too fast for formal education to provide point-by-point training, so marketing professionals will need to continue to adapt, learn as they go, and try something no one\u2019s done before. \u2013 Nicole Martin, managing director, Pace\n\nHard work and networking\n\nNetwork. Louder in the back \u2026 NETWORK! If people don\u2019t start getting out of their homes and back into the world (particularly young professionals), they will miss out on vital opportunities to network with potential clients, mentors, bosses, colleagues, etc. My entire career is built on hard work and networking. \u2013 Kristyn Wilson, executive vice president, digital PR and communication, Adept\n\nDEIB advocacy\n\nMarketers need to amplify their competencies in diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) to connect, find new customers, and drive long-term loyalty. In fact, according to a 2021 Kantar Global Monitor study, it\u2019s no longer a choice but an imperative: Fifty-nine percent of consumers want to buy from brands that actively promote diversity and inclusion in their business, marketplace, and society. And aren\u2019t we supposed to give consumers what they want? \u2013 Karen McFarlane, chief marketing officer, LetterShop x KMC\n\nRelationship and project management, vision, and humanity\n\nThe marketing world is going through a paradigm shift. Going forward, marketing teams need to focus on the things that AI can\u2019t do \u2013 managing relationships, project management, cross-team collaboration, strategy and vision, and human connection.\n\nWhen boiled down to its essence, marketing is about getting people to engage with you. You still need humans to help facilitate that and make it effective. The strength of tools like ChatGPT is not in what they generate. It\u2019s in their conversations with the people on the other side.\n\nThe best results I\u2019ve seen with ChatGPT, Bard, Midjourney, Dall-E, and so on come when I get involved, dig deep, and iterate. That still requires a human mind with innovation, ideas, and a clear vision. So, soft skills are going to become more important. Understanding how to leverage AI is going to become more important. And yes, creativity is not dead; generative AI is just a new kind of paintbrush. \u2013 Inbar Yagur, director, content and product marketing, Lusha\n\nOutcome-driven data analysis\n\nUnderstand how attribution works. It all comes back to analyzing your data on how things are performing and what\u2019s worth the investment. In times of economic turmoil, confidently saying that each dollar invested in marketing yields $3 in sales is golden. But it\u2019s impossible to make this argument if you can\u2019t match the investment to the outcomes. \u2013 Karen Hopper, senior director, performance marketing, Bully Pulpit Interactive\n\nInvest in your future marketing success\n\nExpanding your creative capabilities and technical know-how will benefit your brand, organization, and content marketing career. No matter where your core areas of expertise lie, the more you learn, the more you can achieve.\n\nCover image by Joseph Kalinowski/Content Marketing Institute", "date": "None"}, {"link": "https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/articles/content-creation-authorship-ai", "title": "Audiences Don\u2019t Care If AI Created Your Content", "content": "Business Country *\n\nPlease select United States United Kingdom Canada India Netherlands Australia South Africa France Germany Singapore Sweden Brazil -------------- Afghanistan Aland Islands Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brit/Indian Ocean Terr.

But some economists still predict economic headwinds in the fall, while many say those headwinds turn into tailwinds in late 2023.\n\nWhat\u2019s a marketer to do?\n\nCMI\u2019s chief strategy advisor Robert Rose shares his thoughts in this week\u2019s CMI News video. Watch it below, or keep reading for the highlights:\n\nRobert sees marketing budgets as a leading indicator of the economic temperature. \u201cIf brands put more money into that pool, general growth sentiment is typically at play,\u201d he says.\n\nBudgets got crunched in late 2022 and early this year. The forecast indicates a mixed bag for the second half of the year.\n\nSome predict more slowing of budget growth in advertising, which like the never-arriving recession, seems to be a cost perennially on the chopping block. Some report ad spend will grow more than expected.\n\nAs for marketing, Gartner\u2019s CMO spend survey found budgets remaining flat. CMI\u2019s annual B2B research reported that 50% of marketers expect their content marketing budgets to increase.\n\nCan all of these things be true?\n\nConfessions of a CMO, a study released this week by Optimizely, indicates hidden costs prompt marketers to rethink where they spend their budgets. In tech spending, 72% of marketing leaders acknowledge their tech stacks don\u2019t function as seamlessly as they should. Over half (55%) say making sound investments in tech remains challenging because they have too many options from which to choose. A similar number (52%) cite the staff\u2019s abilities to implement and use those solutions as a contributing factor.\n\nThese findings perfectly follow the thoughts expressed at last week\u2019s ContentTECH event, where Robert talked about the missing link of a cross-functional process \u2013 governance and workflow in marketing and content operations.\n\n\u201cWhenever we see tech isn\u2019t working as seamlessly as it should, that\u2019s not a commentary on the technology. It\u2019s a symptom of an absent or an ill-formed process. That second most popular challenge in the Optimizely survey \u2013 the ability to implement and use the solution \u2013 is all you need to understand tech implementation is a process challenge.\n\nSo, what should marketers focus on in the last half of 2023?\n\nSpend more on content and great media that differentiate your business in the noisy marketplace of ideas.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to move,\u201d Robert says. \u201cYou need to get more efficient. Solve the governance, workflow, and processes of your content operations. Get smarter about where you place your ad dollars as AI and search fundamentally change, and social media transforms before your eyes.\u201d\n\nTreat the next six months as if you were sailing. Tack upwind to your destination, which is the most exhilarating part. Just remember it also requires the most concentration and hard work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy when winds shift to point your boat too close to the wind to try to balance your original direction too much. You slow down your progress,\u201d Robert says.\n\n\u201cThe smart move in sailing and marketing is to ease your sails and increase the boat\u2019s speed at the expense of the original perfect direction. The boat gets easier to steer, and it\u2019s a more comfortable ride for everybody.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s July, folks. Let\u2019s get this boat moving.\n\nThat\u2019s our take. What are your plans for the second half of 2023? Let us know in the comments.\n\nWant more content marketing tips, insights, and examples?

If you neglect them long enough, they sputter and eventually stop running.\n\nYou don\u2019t think about how you work as long as marketing efforts progress. Unspoken rules and unwritten assumptions govern how things are done.\n\nSometimes, the proverbial check-engine light comes on. You stop for a minute, make a quick fix, and get on your way. But mostly, you race from one campaign to the next without thinking about what\u2019s happening under the hood.\n\nThat operational neglect can get expensive. As budgets tighten and uncertainty looms, marketers can\u2019t afford to lose money by working the wrong way. Process improvement may not be the shiniest item on your to-do list, but it could save so much that you don\u2019t even notice the impact of a budget cut.\n\nCommon dysfunctions in marketing ops\n\nIn the 2023 State of Agile Marketing Report (gated), the most popular priorities for marketers this year include:\n\nProducing higher quality content (40%)\n\nPrioritizing the most important work (40%)\n\nBetter aligning with organizational goals and objectives (39%)\n\nImproving the customer experience (38%)\n\nIncreasing the productivity of our marketing departments (36%)\n\nAlso making the list: increasing employee satisfaction and morale (35%), releasing marketing work more quickly (32%), and changing direction in response to feedback (18%).\n\nGetting in the way of those priorities are some common dysfunctional scenarios. Which sounds familiar to you?\n\nEverybody is busy, but nothing gets done. Anyone inside or outside of a team can recognize this problem. Emails go out at midnight; nobody ever really goes on vacation; weekends are a time to catch up, etc. But despite that frantic effort, all the work just drags. Priorities aren\u2019t clear (or change all the time). The work starts and stops a lot. Something critical on Monday falls out of favor by Friday. The marketing plan created at the start of the year gets ignored after February. Work lacks visibility. Even if priorities are clear, the operations can undercut the work if it isn\u2019t visualized. Since no one can see what everybody else is working on, two people replicate the task or spend weeks creating collateral for the same purpose. Speed and quality don\u2019t get along. You\u2019re always up against deadlines, so you eliminate review rounds or hit publish the minute content is ready. You think you have to choose between speed and agility or quality and excellence. Lots of activity occurs, but nobody knows the purpose. Your company thinks the graphics team exists to create pretty emails, or the videographers are too into TikTok. When you can\u2019t tie the content\u2019s purpose to the business goals, you risk losing budget and being excluded from strategic conversations.\n\nToo few marketers see these check-engine lights as an opportunity to improve their processes. Yet, that\u2019s the answer.\n\nImprove critical operations\n\nYou may have tried to solve those operational challenges by buying a new tool, having more meetings, having fewer meetings, etc. But nothing stuck. It\u2019s like when a gas tank is empty, and you add oil. Doing something is not the same as doing the right thing.\n\nFortunately, nearly a decade of Agile marketing learning can point you toward the most important and impactful operational improvements. The State of Agile Marketing report identifies the three most common techniques used by marketing departments \u2013 daily standup (42%), digital Kanban board (36%), and sprint/iteration planning (35%).\n\nDaily standup\n\nThe 15-minute strategy session keeps everybody on the same page for 24 hours. Ideally, you hold them every day and discuss only three things:\n\nWhat have you worked on in the past 24 hours that contributed to the team\u2019s success? What will you work on in the next 24 hours that will contribute to the team\u2019s success? What\u2019s getting in your way?\n\nIt sounds simple, but it takes a lot of discipline to hold these conversations to those three topics and stick to the 15-minute time.\n\nIf you get it right, standups keep work visible, help team members sidestep last-minute requests that derail mission-critical work, and point to places where team members can help each other to get work over the finish line.\n\nDigital Kanban board\n\nAt their simplest, Kanban boards encompass four columns \u2013 to do, doing, review, and done \u2013 with white space below them to add items.\n\nKanban boards can get more complicated and customized, but a simple one is usually your best bet to get started. By visualizing the goals, the board allows the team to get what\u2019s in their heads and inboxes to a place where everyone can see it.\n\nGood leaders don\u2019t use these boards to micromanage their team\u2019s work but to help team members say \u201cno\u201d to work that doesn\u2019t add value to the business or customers.\n\nAs a marketer, you likely work with a lot of internal stakeholders who all think their work is the most important thing you could do. Visualized boards help you navigate these competing priorities and assist leaders in recognizing how many things your team juggles.\n\nOnly when you have all of your tasks in view can you say yes to great, mission-critical work and not right now to everything else.\n\nSprint or iteration planning\n\nSprints are short work cycles, usually two or three weeks, that allow teams to plan, execute, and deliver small chunks of important work. It helps the team avoid missing deadlines or sacrificing quality just to get something out the door.\n\nAlso known as iterations, sprints work well to allow clear moments about when to pivot based on incoming data or shifting priorities. You aren\u2019t locked into a giant plan for the next 12 months. Sprints let you adjust what you\u2019re working on closer to real-time.\n\nDon\u2019t let operations deride marketing success\n\nOperations don\u2019t get their fair share of attention, but they are the engine of your marketing machine.\n\nTake the time to diagnose your malfunctions and put in place some Agile-inspired practices, and you\u2019ll keep the marketing vehicle humming along and delivering results that your executives will appreciate.\n\nRegister to attend Content Marketing World in Washington, D.C.

He writes that the goal is to create a great experience (and, savvy marketers know, to keep people staying on or coming back to Instagram).\n\nAdam explains in detail the individual behaviors that influence what the algorithms serve for each feature \u2013 feeds, Stories, Explore, and Reels. You can use that information to tailor your content so it shows up more often where followers and new audience members will see it.\n\nI\u2019ll explain how and share examples of a few B2B brands creating smart Instagram content.\n\nHow Instagram chooses content to show in feeds and Stories\n\nThese elements influence which recommended content and ads (in order of importance) surface in a user\u2019s feed (i.e., their home base):\n\nUser\u2019s activity \u2013 which posts they liked, shared, saved, or commented on\n\nInformation about the post \u2013 popularity signals (such as likes, comments, shares, and saves), time, and location\n\nInteraction history \u2013 whether the user interacted with an account\u2019s posts (e.g., whether they\u2019ve commented on past posts).\n\nInstagram uses that information to evaluate available content and predict the likelihood of the user spending a few seconds on the post, commenting on it, liking it, sharing it, and tapping on the profile photo.\n\nThe ranking factors for Stories, which typically disappear after 24 hours, are similar to those for feeds. Users only see Stories from accounts they follow.\n\nInstagram algorithms consider all Stories from accounts the user follows (minus any that violate community guidelines). Then it selects what to show based on these input signals (in order of importance):\n\nViewing history \u2013 frequency the user views the account\u2019s Stories\n\nEngagement history \u2013 frequency the user sends a like, a DM, or otherwise engages with the account\u2019s Stories\n\nCloseness \u2013 the user\u2019s relationship with the account and how likely they are connected as friends or families.\n\nWith that information, Instagram predicts which Stories the user will find more valuable \u2013 how likely they are to tap or reply to a story or move on to the next one \u2013 to prioritize which Stories appear higher in the tray.\n\nContent takeaway: It doesn\u2019t matter how big your follower count is if your followers don\u2019t do anything with your content. In planning your posts and Stories, think about what would get a reaction from your audience. Incorporate calls to action that relate to engagement.\n\nYou could make a straightforward request \u2013 please like, comment, or share. Or you could make a more creative request that gives them a reason to like, comment, or share, such as: \u201cWant to know the next part of the story? If enough of you click on like, we\u2019ll share the rest of the story next week.\u201d\n\nYou can Invite them to help: \u201cPlease help us spread the word so more people can learn about XYZ.\u201d Or pose a question and ask them to share their thoughts in the comments \u2013 and reply to each one.\n\nHow Instagram picks content to feature in Explore and Reels\n\nUnlike feeds and Stories, Explore lets users find photos and videos they might be interested in even if they don\u2019t follow the account. Instagram looks at the user\u2019s past activity to understand what content it should show.\n\nFrom there, it orders the photos and videos based on how likely the user is to do something \u2013 like, save, share \u2013 with the content. Among the elements going into that consideration (in order of importance):\n\nPopularity of post \u2013 number of people and quickness they are to like, comment, share, and save it\n\nUser\u2019s Explore activity \u2013 posts liked, saved, shared, or commented on\n\nHistory of interaction \u2013 the user may not know the account that shared the content but may have interacted with it\n\nPoster\u2019s information \u2013 the frequency of interactions with the account in the past few weeks.\n\nInstagram considers Reels as entertainment content, and they often appear from accounts the user doesn\u2019t follow. Instagram surveys users to see if they find a reel fun or worth their time. That feedback improves their predictor algorithm.\n\nIn determining what surfaces, Instagram follows similar criteria to the Explore feature:\n\nUser activity \u2013 Reels liked, saved, reshared, commented on, and engaged with by the user\n\nInteractions with poster \u2013 user\u2019s connection (even when they don\u2019t know the person) with the account\u2019s Reels\n\nInformation about the reel \u2013 audio tracks, visuals, popularity\n\nInformation about the account posting the reel \u2013 number of followers and level of engagement.\n\nContent takeaway: To stand a chance of getting discovered in Reels, you must create Reels \u2013 15- to 30-second videos. Get creative, use effects available in Reels, and focus on the audio.\n\nFor both Reels and Explore results, popularity is the name of the game, so pay attention to the broader Instagram world. You can identify general content, audio, and hashtag trends for Reels through your professional dashboard.\n\nYou also can dive into your analytics to see when your audience is most likely online and plan to publish in those windows to attract more attention and improve the chances the content will surface for non-followers.\n\nWhat if your Instagram content doesn\u2019t surface?\n\nInstagram may give you a hint if your content doesn\u2019t seem to show up in your followers\u2019 feeds and Stories or gets discovered through Explore or Reels.\n\nYou can find that information in the recently upgraded account status feature for professional accounts. Instagram will let you know why your account\u2019s content may not be eligible for recommendations or if it\u2019s available to appear in search. You also can appeal any decisions made by Instagram. Even better, Instagram says it plans to increase transparency down the road.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at three B2B brands that have no problems having their content surface for followers and non-followers alike.\n\n3 B2B brands succeeding on Instagram\n\nQuickbooks, Boeing, and Deloitte create quality Instagram content that every brand can learn from.\n\nQuickBooks\n\nThe financial software provider QuickBooks excels at making its clients the heroes of its Instagram feed. That strategy expands its audience because the subjects of that content will like and share that content.\n\nIn this snapshot, eight of the nine posts on the screen provide content around businesses, ranging from a bookstore owner and ice cream maker to a transportation service and a caf\u00e9. They also showcase a broad geographic range, from Anchorage to Atlanta.\n\nCreating a diverse lineup of client Stories indicates to viewers that QuickBooks likely serves their business and/or in their geographic area, which should expand their audience reach. QuickBooks also does a nice job of mixing the content formats \u2013 from a day in the life of a business owner to five tips for small business success.\n\nIn this post, QuickBooks partnered with its client \u2013 Wilco Supply. Amy Slinker, who owns Wilco Supply, shared her five tips for small business owners. It uses Amy\u2019s voice and video to provide content that her fellow entrepreneurs would benefit from learning.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Intuit QuickBooks (@quickbooks)\n\nQuickBooks also opted to share text related but different than the actual post in the caption: \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret to lasting #SmallBizSuccess? Amy Slinker of Wilco Supply starts by treating her customers like royalty. As a veteran spouse and part-time service member, Amy wanted to offer bags that were fashionable and functional\u2014as well as military compliant\u2014catering to everyone. Here she shares her best tips on how to run a small business. #MilitaryAppreciation #SmallBusiness #SmallBusinessTips #BackSmallBiz\u201d\n\nQuickBooks succinctly sets the stage to understand who Amy is, why it\u2019s telling her story, and what viewers can expect. It also uses popular hashtags for military appreciation and small business topics.\n\nBoeing\n\nInstagram seems like a social platform made for a B2B brand like the aviation giant Boeing. Its products attract interest from customers, vendors, and the general public. That audience \u2013 and the historic nature of this event \u2013 are probably why this reel attracted over 1.6 million views and over 114,000 likes. It includes a simple caption: \u201cThe final 747 took off this morning to join @AtlasAirWorldWide\u2018s fleet. #QueenOfTheSkies\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by The Boeing Company (@boeing)\n\nThe video also is relatively simple \u2013 the 747 taxiing the runway and lifting off as music is interrupted sporadically by air traffic control\u2019s communication to the pilot.\n\nBut what happens when you don\u2019t have the \u201clast\u201d or want to tell a story that won\u2019t appeal to the masses? Think behind the scenes. This reel \u2013 about the brand\u2019s appearance at a Paris trade show \u2013 starts with luggage rolling, gives a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower, and gives a pre-event tour of its display interspersed with video of its plane practicing.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by The Boeing Company (@boeing)\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting reel of the painter applying a logo to a machine. Yes, it\u2019s for NASA, and yes, it\u2019s a spacecraft, but the idea about what happens to create the product can work for all sorts of B2B brands. (You could turn the behind-the-scenes content into a series and invite followers to share what they want to see about your brand.)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by The Boeing Company (@boeing)\n\nDeloitte\n\nDeloitte doesn\u2019t have a visually exciting business, but the provider of financial advisory services tackles Instagram with aplomb. And given it has more than 250,000 followers, I\u2019m not the only one to think so.\n\nHow does a predominantly B2B company where employees sit in front of computers rather than make tangible, visually interesting products do it?\n\nThey focus on people \u2013 their employees, their research, and more (all subjects that will prompt audiences to like, share, and comment on.) As seen on this account page, it publishes a quote from its global chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer to introduce a video post that promotes the upcoming release of its 2023 Deloitte Global LGBT + Inclusion @ Work: a Global Outlook.\n\nNext to its research promotion, it uses a multi-image post to highlight the story of a Deloitte communications leader who works with a foundation to help Afghan women refugees become empowered members of their community. It also incorporates the #BetterFutures hashtag to indicate it\u2019s part of that Deloitte content campaign.\n\nThe third post from Deloitte is a single image with a stat from its quoting a stat from its Gen Z and millennial survey about the role of work in their lives.\n\nDeloitte mixes its content and formats to deliver topics that are unique to its brand and have broader appeal. That strategy likely attracts a more diverse content-consuming audience and helps boost its appearance in Explore and Reels, gaining views from non-followers.\n\nUpdate your Instagram strategy\n\nAdam Mosseri doesn\u2019t really have to become your BFF at work. However, the head of Instagram is worth listening to now as he expands the transparency behind Instagram\u2019s algorithm.\n\nRight now, it all boils down to this: Tell Stories (or posts or Reels) in engaging ways that will attract engagement from your existing audience, and the non-followers are more likely to see them down the road.\n\nWant more content marketing tips, insights, and examples?

If you want to rank higher, it\u2019s time to use advanced content design and development tactics.\n\nThese five actionable tricks will help structure your SEO-focused content for stellar visibility, more traffic, and winning positions on search engine result pages.\n\n1. A <div> snippet\n\nImproving your ranking doesn\u2019t always require significant content updates or heavy link-building. It can be as simple as adding a content block that matches a user search intent using a <div> element with an ID attribute.\n\nDoing so increases the ch that Google will use the content as a featured snippet (also known as position zero), typically a definition, list, image, or video clip on the results page.\n\nThe <div> element works for informational search intent indicators (what and how questions).\n\nIf your target\u2019s search is a \u201cwhat\u201d question, include definitions in your content using a <div> snippet. Place this block under an H2 or H3 header framed as or including a question. It could look like the snippet from this article I wrote about narrative writing shown in the screenshot below. I used an H3 header (Let\u2019s Find Out What Is a Narrative Essay) followed by a sentence formatted as a <div> element that explains narrative essays.\n\nIf your target\u2019s search intent is a \u201chow\u201d question, use the <div> element around a list. Structure each item in the list as short sentences or phrases that answer the \u201chow\u201d question under the content\u2019s title or H2 header within the text.\n\nThe screenshot below shows a <div> formatted element that includes the H2 header \u201cStrategies for writing an essay hook:\u201d followed by a numbered list of 10 essay-writing strategies.\n\nHow do you add the <div> element to content?\n\nGo to the HTML in your website\u2019s admin panel: Use <div id=\u201dfeatured-snippet\u201d>text</div> formatting to structure a text block like a definition under an H2 or H3 header.\n\nThe screenshot below shows the HTML for the narrative essay example, with the sentence \u201cA <strong> narrative essay </strong> is a piece of writing where a student tells a personal story using a storytelling format and all the characteristics of narrative writing.\u201d replacing text in <div> element above.\n\nFor a list, add <div id=\u201dfeatured-snippet\u201d> at the beginning and </div> at the end of the list. The screenshot below shows that I added the <dive id=\u201dfeatured snipped\u201d> element before the H2 header, so it encompasses both the section head and the 10-item list.\n\n2. APP or PPB introductions\n\nAPP (agree, promise, preview) and PPB (preview, proof, bridge) introductions are formulas for writing SEO-rich introductions. Both come from well-known SEO expert Brian Dean, who believes in concise yet informative and engaging opening paragraphs.\n\nThese intro styles can boost dwell time and mitigate the bounce rate because they hook page visitors and motivate them to keep reading. That signals to Google that your content is relevant to search intent and worth higher rankings.\n\nIn general, an opening paragraph should:\n\nBe short.\n\nSet expectations and excite the audience to keep reading.\n\nAnswer the \u201cWhat\u2019s in there for me?\u201d question.\n\nAn APP intro starts with a problem your target reader would agree with, promises to have a solution, and previews the content so users know what they\u2019ll get.\n\nIn the CMI article 7 Formulas for Writing Introductions That Convert Scanners Into Readers, the author\u2019s introduction uses the APP approach. Olesia Filipenko wrote this introduction (I\u2019ve labeled each of the APP elements in the text below and in the screenshot):\n\nAgree: Readers pay attention to only about 20% of the words on a web page. They prefer to skim tables of content and subheads. They want to know if your content is worth their time and effort. Add to that the mere seconds you have to grab and hold readers\u2019 interest, and the battle for the audience may seem lost.\n\nReaders pay attention to only about 20% of the words on a web page.

Custom images\n\nProper image optimization can boost your page\u2019s load time, influencing behavioral factors Google considers for rankings. Visuals also can drive traffic when they appear in Google image results or as image packs in featured snippets. (Images displayed in search results do not necessarily come from the page or article in the featured snippet.)\n\nCrafting original, high-quality, and informative images for your content assets boosts the chances of your visuals appearing in results.\n\nThink of sharing potential. Design infographics, diagrams, charts, screenshots, checklists, and product images demonstrating relevant and practical data for the audience. Place your brand logo and industry insights there, thus encouraging users to share your visuals and earning coveted backlinks to your website as the image\u2019s source.\n\nTo optimize your image files:\n\nUse relevant names for image files. Make them keyword-rich and descriptive, so Google can understand the context.\n\nPay attention to file size and compress images before uploading if necessary.\n\nCreate relevant and SEO-friendly <alt> text for images.\n\nDevelop an image sitemap on the website.\n\nPlace images near the most relevant text describing its context.\n\n4. 10x content assets\n\nGoogle uses hundreds of factors to assess your content to decide where it should rank. Experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (EEAT) make up the bulk of its quality guidelines.\n\nThat means it\u2019s not enough to write a good content asset. (Many content creators and SEO writers do this.) Your content should come from expert sources, be authoritative, trustworthy, valuable for users, and be crafted by an author with experience in the niche.\n\nTo achieve that, write assets that are at least 10 times better than the content in the top three organic search result positions for the topic and keyword.\n\nTo write content that follows EEAT guidelines and improves upon the top results, create a better version. It could be:\n\nMore comprehensive: Do better research. Illustrate different angles. Provide steps and examples, or add comments from experts.\n\nDo better research. Illustrate different angles. Provide steps and examples, or add comments from experts. More up-to-date: Share the latest data and trends. Structure the design for better usability that\u2019s easier to consume.\n\nRemember to mention the content\u2019s author on the page. Place a photo and add an informative bio to demonstrate expertise. Here\u2019s an example of author Robert Rose\u2019s credentials on the Content Marketing Institute page. The description highlights his consulting firm (The Content Advisory) and two of his books (Killing Marketing and Managing Content Marketing).\n\nYou also could implement these two 10x-related ideas:\n\nOrganize it in topic clusters . Craft a pillar page targeting a high-volume keyword. Create a few related content assets, each targeting a more specific, smaller-volume keyword. Interlink the clustered content to win more traffic from organic search.\n\nCraft a pillar page targeting a high-volume keyword. Create a few related content assets, each targeting a more specific, smaller-volume keyword. Interlink the clustered content to win more traffic from organic search. Optimize it for common questions. Add an FAQ section with answers or format relevant questions as content subheads.\n\n5. Formatting\n\nReaders typically consume a small portion of the content. They also read more slowly online than they do in print. Given that, why make it challenging for the target audience to consume your asset, thus hurting its behavioral factors and overall performance?\n\nInstead, think about usability when formatting your content:\n\nFollow the rules of web writing. Make paragraphs short. Use a simple text structure (nothing higher than an H3 header in the text hierarchy). Consider conversational language, and add transitional words throughout the text to encourage further reading.\n\nMake paragraphs short.

Search optimization requires top-notch assets.\n\nExpert, comprehensive, and valuable content calls the shots now. To please search engines and attract users, consider the EEAT factors, craft well-rounded content matching your targets\u2019 search intent, and format it with usability in mind.\n\nRegister to attend Content Marketing World in Washington, D.C.

It allows audiences to view your brand as a trusted resource for valuable information, not a product-hawking promotional engine.\n\nThe first step? Think outside your company.\n\nThird-party sources can elevate the conversation with multiple and diverse viewpoints, examples, and experiences. In turn, the audience is more likely to consume and engage with the content because they recognize the publishing brand as an independent media resource, not a vendor of products and services.\n\nLet\u2019s explore five paths to inject relevant and helpful external sources into your articles, infographics, videos, podcasts, and any other kind of content:\n\nAsk industry-, role-, or geographic-specific organizations.\n\nConnect on interactive platforms.\n\nSeek non-human sources.\n\nUse Qwoted as a brand journalist.\n\nBuild a source network.\n\nAsk industry-, role-, or geographic-specific groups and associations\n\nTens of thousands of professional and trade organizations exist in the United States alone. The American Society of Association Executives (ASAE) reports over 7,400 member organizations, and estimates show that the total number in the United States is more than 56,000. At least one of them likely connects to your content\u2019s subject matter.\n\nTo find knowledgeable sources in these organizations, check out their websites:\n\nIdentify senior leaders and their specialty areas, then email or call the one most relevant to your content topic.\n\nReview board members to see which companies they represent and contact those who represent brands your audience will recognize.\n\nAttend the organization\u2019s in-person events to connect with potential sources. Go to the annual trade show and talk to some attendees to get a better understanding of their expertise. Ask them if you could reach out in the future when you\u2019re creating content where their input would be helpful.\n\nExample\n\nThis article, from Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 The DELMIA Blog, about closing the gender gap in the workplace includes an interview with the CEO of a relevant national organization.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the article:\n\nTeniel Jones is president and CEO of Base 11, a national organization dedicated to helping women and Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) blaze a trail in STEM industries. I think the most apparent challenge female students face in the education system is sexism, said Jones. There is an ill-conceived perception that women can\u2019t learn or study in the same fields men can, and these perceptions start at birth. We set up different gender expectations for boys and girls, which translates to STEM.\n\nConnect on interactive platforms\n\nUse your brand\u2019s social channels to elicit input from your existing audience. This works well for reaction-focused or crowdsourced content because it lets you incorporate many voices in your piece \u2013 and you can do it quickly. (Don\u2019t forget to mention in your social post that you may use their responses in an upcoming article, video, or podcast.)\n\nBut don\u2019t limit your outreach to your social channels:\n\nTag your request for sources using relevant hashtags.\n\nPost to topic-related LinkedIn or Facebook groups.\n\nUse crowdsourcing sites like Quora and Reddit to identify contributors to posts about your topic, industry, or content angle. Reach out to them individually.\n\nExample\n\nEvery year, I ask on social media for recommendations for CMI\u2019s annual book gift guide. Last year, I received over a dozen responses on LinkedIn that went into the 2022 version.\n\nTIP: Incorporate relevant existing content from social media \u2013 with the poster\u2019s permission \u2013 into your content. For example, Kate Parish recently incorporated a Twitter conversation started by Elna Cain into this article about AI detection tools:\n\nSeek non-human sources\n\nIndustry and professional organizations, as well as other brands, also can be a great resource for research, white papers, and other media coverage. If you can\u2019t get to the right person to interview, the next best thing may be a blog or other media coverage quoting that person \u2013 just make sure to cite and link to the original source.\n\nExample\n\nPaycor, an HR platform provider, cited a statistic (98% want to work remotely for the rest of their career) from the State of Remote Work research by Buffer (a third-party source) in its article about remote work reimbursement rules.\n\nHere\u2019s the excerpt showing how they included the statistic:\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to say that remote work is the new normal for many Americans. Today, more than 27.6 million people work from home as opposed to the roughly 9 million people in 2019 (American Community Survey). And, those who don\u2019t would like to. 98% of respondents in Buffer\u2019s 2023 Remote Work Survey of 3000 would like to work remotely for the rest of their careers (Buffer). Remote-first organizations can make big savings on real estate\u2014but are they required to instead pay for remote employees\u2019 expenses? When employees work from home, they use their own electricity, internet and (often) office supplies. What portion of these business-related expenses are, or should be, reimbursable?\n\nBe a brand journalist on Qwoted\n\nQwoted is a relatively new service used by the marketing communication/PR world to connect the brand\u2019s experts with the media. But content marketers can use it too \u2013 taking the journalist\u2019s role to seek sources for their content. And it\u2019s free.\n\nTIP: Be specific and succinct in your query. Include what you need AND what you don\u2019t need. \u201cQuery: Seeking phone interview with trucking industry expert on the impact of fuel prices. Already have sufficient responses from fuel brands or individual truck drivers.\u201d\n\nGo through the responses with a discerning eye. Delete those that don\u2019t meet your needs. Then go through to see who has the most surprising or interesting relevant responses. Use the submitted responses or follow-up to interview those responders to generate that fresh content your audience wants.\n\nExample\n\nIn this article about the role of Twitter in marketing after Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition, I received a dozen or so responses to my query on Qwoted and picked a handful to include:\n\nBuild a source network\n\nAs you cultivate new sources for your content, make sure to document their participation and contact information. Create a master spreadsheet for your team. Include the person\u2019s name, title, organization, contact information, and social handles, and note their areas of specialty. Then reach out to them when you want their input on the content being created.\n\nAlso, add a column for links to content where your company included that source. That way, your content team isn\u2019t using the same source over and over. (It\u2019s really tempting to reach out too frequently to a great source you can depend on.)\n\nThere\u2019s no single best way to incorporate external sources into your content marketing. Whether you connect more with your industry trade group, look for existing external references, use online communities, or put a query out to Qwoted\u2019s database, you\u2019ll create more credible content to position your company as a go-to media brand for your audience.\n\nHow do you develop your source network?

For the 2023 season, ARound has expanded its offerings by integrating real-time sports APIs to give Twins fans access to in-depth statistics during games.\n\nWith this expansion, fans of the Minnesota team can view stats like spray charts, exit velocities and launch angles in AR, with the on-screen information matching each person\u2019s real-world view of the ballpark. Fans can also view historical data for players and teams, as well as access educational content related to the sport.\n\nThe ARound app is available for free on iOS and Android devices. The platform\u2019s official MLB statistics have been licensed from sports technology company Sportradar.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to introduce our fans to this next-level experience that will resonate with avid and casual fans alike,\u201d said Chris Iles, Minnesota Twins senior director of innovation and growth. \u201cThese broadcast-style data visualizations served in real-time, and customized to where fans are in Target Field, have the potential to significantly enhance the way fans enjoy Twins games while bridging generations of baseball fans.\u201d\n\nThis update also added retailer Target to the platform\u2019s Batter Up AR game, which allows fans to compete with others during Twins games. Target\u2019s bull terrier mascot, Bullseye, has been added as the AR game\u2019s pitcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made incredible inroads in shared AR since piloting this app with the Twins last August, consistently refining the platform in response to fan and team feedback,\u201d said Josh Beatty, founder and CEO of ARound. \u201cIncorporating stats into the experience was a frequent request.

For the third year, Mastercard sponsored MLB\u2019s Home Team Advantage Small Business Contest, which gave winning businesses $10,000, a Mastercard Digital Doors 2.0 toolkit, in-stadium ads in their home market and a trip to the All-Star Game, where they get to throw out a ceremonial first pitch.\n\nMastercard also gets its business-to-business side in the game by airing a new \u201cLook Closer\u201d ad for its NuDetect fraud detection technology\u2014which MLB uses to verify All-Star Game voting\u2014twice during the game it\u2019s sponsoring.\n\n\u201cIt ties back to what our brand is all about, our foundation in \u2018Priceless\u2019 and experiences mattering more than things,\u201d said Anne Valentzas, Mastercard\u2019s svp of consumer marketing and head of sponsorships for North America. \u201cSo even if we were to leverage an NFT, we\u2019re not a brand who is going to bring that to our cardholders as an object. \u2026 There are always going to be experiences tied to it.\u201d\n\nThe All-Star Game\u2019s growth into a five-day All-Star Week\u2014which Adweek will be covering in full this year\u2014has provided brands with an increasing number of opportunities to leave their mark on one of baseball\u2019s marquee events. In the middle of summer with few other major sporting events to compete with, All-Star Week represents a quiet time on the sports calendar\u2014with enough space for brands looking to make some noise.\n\nExpanding the playing field\n\nBaseball\u2019s last All-Star stop in Seattle looked much smaller 22 years ago. The league\u2019s Futures Game of young talent and Celebrity Softball Game were in their earliest stages. There was no red carpet show before the All-Star Game itself, and the MLB Draft wasn\u2019t moved to All-Star Week until last year.\n\nOverall, there were far fewer brands in play, with an MLB spokesman noting that the number of official league sponsors in 2001 was about half of what it is today. The only holdovers from that era are Mastercard, All-Star Workout Day sponsor Gatorade and MLB\u2019s longest-standing sponsor, Anheuser-Busch\u2019s Budweiser.\n\nThe beer brand will still give fans a chance to win free beer for the season with its \u201cHit the Buds\u201d in-game campaign, while inviting fans on the grounds to its Budweiser Clubhouse to hang out at the bar, take swings in the batting cages and meet the Clydesdales. It\u2019ll even be teaming with Ken Griffey Jr. to sell Budweiser x @therealkengriffeyjr All-Star Collection merchandise at ShopBeerGear.com.\n\n\u201cAs the beer synonymous with baseball, Budweiser is continuing its commitment to celebrating America\u2019s favorite pastime by bringing 21 [and older] fans closer to the action throughout the season, including this year\u2019s game in Seattle,\u201d said Kristina Punwani, head of marketing for Budweiser U.S.\n\nBut All-Star Week\u2019s growth means Budweiser is no longer alone. Last year, Constellation Brands\u2019 Corona became the Official Cerveza of Major League Baseball and began featuring prominently at the league\u2019s premier events. At last year\u2019s All-Star Week in Los Angeles, Corona had a little fun with trading cards, but kept its presence somewhat modest.\n\nFor 2023? Corona\u2019s placed its brand on the Celebrity Softball Game and its Major League Vibes Fan Cam. Around T-Mobile Park, there\u2019ll be Corona Adirondack chairs for fans to relax in and, at the event\u2019s fan-and-brand festival, there\u2019s a chance for fans to make their own walk-up songs and hear Spotify\u2019s \u201cWalk Up to the Fine Life\u201d playlist of iconic walkup songs.\n\nRoughly 20 million Americans identify as both Hispanic and MLB fans, with Hispanic and Latino players making up roughly 30% of MLB rosters. A partner of both MLB and the Seattle Mariners, Corona is using its All-Star moment to connect with fans on multiple levels.\n\n\u201cThis is a great opportunity to demonstrate the expanded impact a partnership like this can have\u2014bringing \u2018La Vida Mas Fina\u2019 to life on national and local level in the Emerald City of Seattle,\u201d said Alex Schultz, vp of brand marketing at Corona. \u201cAll-Star Week is such a unique moment during the season: The vibrancy and fun atmosphere of All-Star week is a perfect fit with our Corona ethos and to fans of the fine life, so it\u2019s exciting to tap into this feeling during this celebration of baseball.\u201d\n\nUpward mobility\n\nFew brands have benefitted from All-Star Week\u2019s expansion quite as broadly as MLB sponsor and All-Star Game host ballpark namesake T-Mobile.\n\nThe presenting sponsor of All-Star Week\u2019s opening HBCU Swingman Classic\u2014an exhibition game hosted by Ken Griffey Jr. featuring baseball players from historically Black colleges and universities\u2014T-Mobile also has its brand on the Home Run Derby (which will feature the Seattle Mariners\u2019 Julio Rodriguez, who co-stars with actor Ben Barnes in T-Mobile\u2019s latest spot) and the All-Star Red Carpet Show just before the game.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s technology will be all over the event as well, with the MLB Next app giving fans Home Run Derby and All-Star Game access to video data including hit distance, launch angle, an interactive strike zone, and audio of the live ESPN and Fox broadcasts.\n\nMLB will test its automated balls and strikes (ABS) system on T-Mobile\u2019s 5G network during the Futures Game, while T-Mobile will host 5G BP for up-close drone-filmed views of Home Run Derby warmups. Finally, T-Mobile will be giving away customized All-Star bats at one of its Seattle stores, free New Era All-Star Week caps during T-Mobile Tuesday on July 11 and spots in The \u2018Pen viewing area in the outfield of T-Mobile Park to loyal customers.\n\n\u201cThe ABS system and MLB Next app demonstrate the power and possibilities of 5G innovation and its ability to transform the game\u2014and there\u2019s no better ballpark for this to come to life than at T-Mobile Park in our hometown.\u201d said Mike Katz, president of marketing, innovation and experience at T-Mobile.\n\nT-Mobile graciously shares the Home Run Derby spotlight with Gatorade, which hosts its All-Star Workout Day on the same day. An MLB partner since 1990, Gatorade has worked on drinks with athletes including Derek Jeter and Bryce Harper, and keeps lining All-Star Week dugouts with its orange coolers. It\u2019ll be giving away samples of its new Fast Twitch drink throughout the event and featuring other products prominently throughout pre-Derby warmups.\n\nFrom fan fest to brand fest\n\nWhile Major League Baseball added the yet-unbranded MLB Draft to All-Star Week activities last year and features the three-day event as part of the 2023 festivities, perhaps the greatest change to All-Star Week since 2001 from a brand perspective is the supersized fan festival.\n\nKnown simply as FanFest 22 years ago, it was a much smaller memorabilia-centric event within a stadium exhibition center just outside the ballpark. Today, Capital One\u2019s Play Ball Park is housed within Lumen Field\u2014home of the National Football League\u2019s Seattle Seahawks\u2014and is teeming with brands.\n\nYou can get mattress advice from experts at MattressFirm, take a photo of your sweet bat flip at T-Mobile\u2019s Bat Flip cage or watch a hen strut around its 108 square feel of range space as New Hampshire-based Pete and Gerry\u2019s sell their pasture-raised eggs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always found the connections between mass-market sports, and MLB is a great one,\u201d said Pete & Gerry\u2019s CEO Tom Flocco. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to connect with interested fans and broaden the appeal\u201497% of homes buy eggs and a lot of people watch baseball, so for us it\u2019s a great intersection.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to expand business west of the Mississippi River, Pete & Gerry\u2019s has spent much of the last year teaming with MLB to increase its profile. It took over MLB\u2019s homepage for Father\u2019s Day, held a sweepstakes to send fans to All-Star Week, and will have a 400-square-foot area in Play Ball Park and a tent on the T-Mobile Park concourse with a giant hen named Shelly, games, egg-shaped baseballs and plush toy hens.\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s MLB Next app adds layers to already dense All-Star Week branding.\n\nThere will be a Spot Shelly game on the ballpark\u2019s video screen, social media posts with Shelly and a digital raffle during the Home Run Derby once the players hit 108 home runs\u2014equal to the number of square feet each pasture-raised chicken has to roam. It\u2019s space that may not have existed for Pete & Gerry\u2019s during previous All-Star Weeks.\n\n\u201cFor the consumer who buys pasture-raised eggs, she recognizes that number; it\u2019s a number that\u2019s fixed in our head: 108 square feet,\u201d said Pete & Gerry\u2019s CMO Phyllis Rothschild. \u201cBut our goal is to broaden it and do more \u2018eggucation\u2019 and get more people to recognize the value of a pasture-raised hen and our eggs in particular.\u201d", "date": "None"}, {"link": "https://www.adweek.com/creativity/silver-pride-project-brings-lgbtq-pioneers-back-to-parades/", "title": "Silver Pride: Project Brings LGBTQ+ Pioneers Back to Parades", "content": "Brandweek will feature live discussions with marketing pros at Dakota Media , Converse , UPS and more.

Two more events are planned so far, one for Europride in Malta in September and the other for Atlanta Pride in October, but others could be added.\n\n\u201cIn our heads, we\u2019d love to turn this into a yearly initiative that happens in different cities,\u201d Angelus told Adweek.\n\nHonoring the pioneers\n\nSilver Pride was several months in the making, but much longer as a gestating idea for Angelus, who identifies as part of the LGBTQ+ community. He felt compelled to uplift the early activists who had become sadly invisible in the modern movement.\n\n\u201cI realized that the community itself needed to be reminded that we can\u2019t forget the generation that fought for our rights,\u201d Angelus told Adweek. \u201cWe needed to bring them back to Pride, honor them, celebrate them.\u201d\n\nAt a time when LGBTQ+ rights are under attack in the U.S. and elsewhere, it\u2019s crucial to lift up the trailblazers.\n\n\u201cThey fought against prejudice, hate, they were pointed out as the culprits of the AIDS epidemic,\u201d Angelus said. \u201cBut if there are laws today for gay marriage, against discrimination, for gay adoption \u2026 if we have something called Pride month at all, it\u2019s thanks to their blood, sweat and tears.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSilver Pride brought back early LGBTQ+ activists who have been sitting out senior-unfriendly events.\n\nAs part of his groundwork, Angelus brought in nonprofit group Les Audacieuses et Les Audacieux. The organization shared with him some startling data about isolation and depression among LGBTQ+ seniors, 65% of whom live alone and 90% who have no children or family caregivers. Suicide rates in the demo are between two and seven times higher than the straight population.\n\n\u201cThe statistics are scary,\u201d Angelus said. \u201cFor a lot of LGBTQ seniors, the community is their family, especially when their real families have turned their backs on them.\u201d\n\n\u2018Very emotional\u2019 day\n\nLes Audacieuses et Les Audacieux helped to locate seniors who wanted to attend Paris Pride but were daunted by the heat, noise and inaccessibility of the event. Given the elderly folks\u2019 history of activism, \u201cknowing that they are excluded is just impossible for us,\u201d said Michael Simon, a member of the nonprofit.\n\nThe brand-backed program, meant to serve as an authentic counterpoint to rampant pinkwashing, was a hit with its guests, as seen in an accompanying campaign video.\n\nBut the impact was wider\u2014there was an outpouring of support from media and influencers in the run-up to the parade, with press interviews and social sharing about the program and its participants.\n\nOn event day, marchers embraced the seniors from the street level, waving the silver-striped flag and interacting with them.\n\n\u201cIt was beautiful to see everyone looking up at the balconies and cheering them on,\u201d Angelus said. \u201cIt was very emotional.\u201d\n\nA tearful Tracol, featured in the video\u2019s final frames clutching the flag and touching her heart, thanked the organizers for returning her to the event: \u201cI thought I would never be able to do it ever again.\u201d", "date": "None"}, {"link": "https://www.adweek.com/creativity/apples-action-packed-tale-pays-homage-to-mexicos-lucha-libre-wrestlers/", "title": "Apple\u2019s Action-Packed Tale Pays Homage to Mexico\u2019s Lucha Libre Wrestlers", "content": "Brandweek will feature live discussions with marketing pros at Dakota Media , Converse , UPS and more. Meet us in Miami Sept. 11\u201314 to boost your business and elevate your brand.\n\nLucha Libre, a form of professional wrestling, is a cultural phenomenon in Mexico. Distinguished by its colorful masks and acrobatic moves, the sport has a rich legacy dating back over a century.\n\nApple pays homage to Lucha Libre in the first installment of its long-running \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d campaign to be produced entirely in Mexico.\n\nThe 13-minute film, titled \u201cHurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez vs. La Pi\u00f1ata Enchilada,\u201d tells the story of a retired luchador (wrestler) who dons his mask one more time to fight against a pi\u00f1ata villain that is terrorizing the locals. The star of the spot is Hurac\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez, the first luchador character created for a movie in 1952 (numerous Mexican wrestlers have worked under that name since).\n\nAlong with Ram\u00edrez, another well-known luchador, called Dr. Wagner, also makes an appearance.\n\nApple\u2019s tale is set in various locations across Mexico City, with action-packed scenes that show off the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s cinematic capabilities. For example, a shot of kids running for help demonstrates the stability of the phone\u2019s Action Mode, while dark cavernous fighting sequences were filmed with the Low Light feature.\n\nLOS P\u00c9REZ\u2013the alter ego of directing and writing duo Tania Verduzco and Adri\u00e1n P\u00e9rez\u2013directed the film entirely with the iPhone.\n\nIt will run online, TV and in theatres. Apple has also created movie posters, outdoor ads that depict luchadores performing their most famous moves, and a behind-the-scenes video narrated by Leo Magad\u00e1n, one of the most influential voices in Mexico\u2019s Lucha Libre history.\n\nApple has previously adapted its \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d campaign for other countries, such as a Korean film shot by acclaimed director Park Chan-wook last year.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nAgency: TBWA\\Media Arts Lab Latam\n\nProduction company: The Lift\n\nDirector: LOS P\u00c9REZ\n\nMusic: Kenny y Los El\u00e9ctricos, Nortec Collective, Revueltas by Xalapa Symphony Orchestra", "date": "None"}, {"link": "https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ken-griffey-jr-and-t-mobile-go-to-bat-for-black-ballplayers/", "title": "Ken Griffey Jr. and T-Mobile Go to Bat for Black Ballplayers", "content": "Brandweek will feature live discussions with marketing pros at Dakota Media , Converse , UPS and more. Meet us in Miami Sept. 11\u201314 to boost your business and elevate your brand.\n\nWhat value does Major League Baseball\u2019s All-Star Week hold if future generations don\u2019t see themselves among the sport\u2019s elite\u2026 or even on its field?\n\nWhen Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. was in the early days of his career with the Seattle Mariners in 1991, Black players made up 18% of baseball\u2019s rosters. As the All-Star Game returns to Seattle for the first time since 2001, The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports (TIDES) noted that Black players make up just 6.2% of baseball rosters.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we have seen the decline of African-American players not because they don\u2019t want to play, but rather because they haven\u2019t been seen,\u201d Griffey said.\n\nComing back to Seattle for All-Star Week, Griffey is teaming with his partners at MLB and its players association\u2014as well as brands like T-Mobile, Nike, Chevrolet and concessionaire Sodexo\u2014to address baseball\u2019s culture and bring Black players back into the game.\n\nAs an ambassador for MLB and MLBPA\u2019s Youth Development Foundation\u2014which promotes and sponsors amateur baseball and softball\u2014Griffey is using his own brand to kick off All-Star Week with the first HBCU Swingman Classic on Friday night at Seattle\u2019s T-Mobile Park.\n\nOver the years, we have seen the decline of African-American players, not because they don\u2019t want to play but rather because they haven\u2019t been seen. Ken Griffey Jr.\n\nThe event brings in players and alumni coaches from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for an exhibition game, but also tries to forge connections that have been lost to Major League Baseball for generations. As the league experiments with events like the Hank Aaron Invitational\u2014which reaches out to high school players of diverse backgrounds\u2014both the game and its sponsors have realized that changing a culture requires full-time commitment.\n\n\u201cHighlighting the talent at HBCU baseball programs is an important part of how we connect with college baseball while also improving African-American representation at all levels of our game,\u201d said MLB chief baseball development officer Tony Reagins.\n\nCooking up connections\n\nKevin Fletcher grew up considering Ken Griffey Jr. the greatest baseball player of all time. When Fletcher was really drawn to baseball\u2014during the Mark McGwire/Sammy Sosa home run chase of 1998\u2014he watched Griffey win the All-Star Week Home Run Derby at Coors Field in Denver with his hat on backward, then again at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park in 1999.\n\n\u201cI played baseball for one year, found out I was terrible, and my mom said never again,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I play MLB The Show every day. I\u2019ve got a great franchise going, it\u2019s been six years and two World Series.\u201d\n\nWhen Fletcher turned 25, he left his career as a DJ to use the cooking talents he\u2019d acquired from his grandmother and pursue a career as a chef, which led him to Sodexo, where he answered a listing from Howard University seeking an executive chef to change the culture and content of the school\u2019s dining program.\n\nDuring the Swingman Classic in Seattle, Fletcher is representing both Howard and T-Mobile Park concessionaire Sodexo Live by preparing menus alongside executive chefs from other Sodexo-served HBCUs.\n\n\u201cI wear a chef\u2019s coat with Howard University on my chest every day and was just like, \u2018I\u2019m just going to work to make a difference in these kids\u2019 lives,\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018No, this is something bigger than you,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m starting to understand that and always challenge myself to think bigger and broader, because it\u2019s more than just a dining hall\u2014this is history. There are so many people that are connected to this university, so I\u2019ve got to make sure that I\u2019m on my A game at all times.\u201d\n\nBuilding beyond baseball\n\nGriffey and his counterparts at MLB have reached out to HBCU contacts and ensured that all details are covered. Members of the Negro Leagues Family Alliance will be recognized prior to the first pitch, when Griffey will join HBCU notables including Hall of Famer Andre Dawson, College Baseball Hall of Fame coach Roger Cador, College Baseball Hall of Famer Rickie Weeks and former Atlanta Braves All-Star Ralph Garr.\n\nGrammy-nominated gospel artist (and former minor leaguer) Todd Dulaney, with Seattle church choir all-stars Songs of Black Folk Celebration Chorus, will perform \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing.\u201d\n\nSouthwestern Athletic Conference baseball announcer Marque Denmon fills in for the Mariners\u2019 Tom Hutyler, while the Dolls & Gents Drumline and Drill Team of HBCU alumni will perform during player introductions and two-inning breaks. The game starts at 7:42 p.m. in honor of Griffey (No. 7) and Jackie Robinson (whose No. 42 is retired leaguewide).\n\nEven the sponsors took extra steps beyond simply slapping their logo on the event. Presenting sponsor T-Mobile is presenting its T-Mobile Impact Award to a participating athlete for their leadership and community commitment. In early 2024, T-Mobile will host an HBCU Athlete Summit for student-athletes who participated in the Swingman Classic. The event will feature panel discussions, roundtable talks and networking opportunities with T-Mobile HBCU alumni, executive leaders and former student-athletes. They will get to look behind the scenes at T-Mobile corporate facilities and consider careers with the company.\n\n\u201cAs a company with a longstanding commitment to [diversity, equity and inclusion] and a longtime partnership with MLB, we\u2019re proud to support this event and MLB\u2019s goal of promoting greater diversity in baseball,\u201d said Mike Katz, president of marketing, innovation and experience at T-Mobile. \u201cRepresentation matters, and in baseball it\u2019s important to give players a platform to demonstrate their talent on a significant stage like what this event provides.\u201d\n\nChevrolet is bringing its \u201cDiscover the Unexpected\u201d (DTU) partnership with the National Newspaper Publishers Association to the Swingman Classic and giving marketing and journalism fellows from HBCUs a chance to cover the event and interview players. Getty Images, meanwhile, has invited two members of its HBCU photographer mentorship program and one HBCU student photographer to photograph the Classic and other All-Star events for an exhibit showcasing HBCU sports culture.\n\nGriffey, the YDF and the United Negro College Fund of Seattle are prefacing Swingman with an HBCU fair at T-Mobile park featuring recruiters and alumni groups from nine HBCUs and seven Divine Nine fraternities and sororities. While there will be donations to the United Negro College Fund, the Black Play-by-Play Grant and Scholarship Fund, and space for Black-owned vendors, Swingman\u2019s greatest potential lies in its ability to draw attention on the MLB Network and SiriusXM and, eventually, increased funding for HBCU baseball programs from MLB and its partners.\n\n\u201cI am excited to help these kids get the national attention that they don\u2019t receive compared to other college baseball programs,\u201d Griffey said. \u201cCollege scholarships for baseball are not comparative to other sports, and a lot of families cannot afford to pay the difference. So, this effort is the industry coming together to give these kids an opportunity to play the game they love on the national stage.\u201d", "date": "None"}, {"link": "https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/content-is-king-for-major-league-baseballs-european-expansion/", "title": "Content Is Key for Major League Baseball's Euro Expansion", "content": "\u201cIf you build it, they will come,\u201d is the mystical piece of advice given to Kevin Costner in arguably the greatest movie about baseball ever made, 1989\u2019s Field of Dreams.
